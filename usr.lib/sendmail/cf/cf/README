This directory contains cf files for these machines:

	cad
	cadgroup	/* any cadgroup machine */
	cogsci
	okeeffe
	ucbarpa
	ucbvax

	ucbtcp.cf	/* any nameserver machine */
	ucbtcp_fw.cf	/* ditto, but that uses /usr/lib/sendmail.cw */

Most all of the good stuff is contained in ucbproto.cf.  For most
machines, all the .mc files do is define some m4 constants and
include ucbproto.mc.
