Things that you should be aware of:

1.  At Sun, RPC is part of the C library.  This makefile will make a library
called rpclib.

2.  I have added two other files - portmap.c and rcpinfo.c; they usually
do not live in this directory.  Also, both files
assume that the rpc dot h files have been installed in /usr/include.

portmap.c is the source to /etc/portmap, the rpc deamon which must be started
by root before any other rpc based servers or clients.

rpcinfo.c dumps the information that the portmap keeps; at Sun, it lives
in /usr/etc/rpcinfo.

3. The rpc library was built with a post-1.1 Sun release of the compiler.
Old compilers complain about valid C.  You can make old compilers happy
by changing some voids to ints.

4. The documentation is in ditroff form in subdirectory doc.  It depends
on a Sun macro package (/usr/lib/tmac/tmac.sun) which I have included.
