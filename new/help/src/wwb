.TI WWB
Text Analysis with the Writer's Workbench System

Writer's Workbench (WWB) is a collection of programs to
do proofreading and stylistic analysis of text files,
together with checks for spelling, punctuation, diction,
and doubled words.

The WWB programs are not automatically available to users since
they are located in a non-standard command directory, /usr/wwb/bin.
To make them accessible to you, you can edit your ".login" file
and add /usr/wwb/bin to your "path" variable.
If the following example is too brief, type "help .login"
and "help searchpath" for more information.
As an example, your ".login" file might contain the path definition

	set path = (/usr/ucb /bin /usr/bin .)

which you could change to

	set path = (/usr/ucb /usr/wwb/bin /bin /usr/bin .)

This would give you access to the WWB commands, which are:

.nf
	abst        match       prosestand  splitrules  wwbaid
	acro        mkstand     punct       style       wwbhelp
	deroff      org         punctrules  syl         wwbinfo
	dictadd     parts       sexist      topic       wwbman
	diction     proofer     spelladd    wc          
	double      proofr      spelltell   worduse     
	findbe      prose       spellwwb    wwb         
.fi

Manual pages for these commands are available on-line via
the "wwbman" command (once your path has been set correctly),
and hardcopies are available from the Academic
Computing Services Library, 218 Evans.
Currently we provide no consulting or bug-fixing support for WWB.
The WWB system also comes with its own on-line
documentation system consisting of the three commands:  wwbaid,
wwbhelp, and wwbinfo.

As you experiment with them and the rest of the WWB system,
you may notice a different style of presentation from
the one to which you are accustomed.
For example, sometimes the output pauses after each screenful
and requires you to type RETURN to continue (not SPACE, with
which most users at Berkeley are familiar).
Sometimes the output does not pause at all; in these cases
you may want to redo the last command adding "| more" to
the end in order to read the output conveniently.
Also, references to BREAK mean the command-kill character
(or interrupt character), often Control-C.
The next two pages are taken from the manual pages for wwbaid.

.SH GETTING STARTED

All users of the Writer's Workbench system will find the user's aid helpful.
For the old hand, it has many good memory-jogging features.
For the newcomer, the user's aid can be used as a learning aid.
.PP
On occasion, you may want a list of all the Writer's Workbench system commands.
To get a list, type:
.PP
.ce
.B "wwbaid cmds"
.PP
If you are not familiar with the Writer's Workbench system
or the user's aid, 
you might find it convenient to use the on-line instruction session
as an introduction.
You can access it by typing:
.PP
.ce
.B "wwbaid instruct"
.PP
When you are familiar with the seven 
.I topics
that answer questions about Writer's Workbench system commands,
use the 
.B index
.I topic
to explore some of the features
of the Writer's Workbench system.
If you type:
.PP
.ce
.B "wwbaid open"
.PP
and press RETURN,
the program will answer you with:
.IP
.sp
For which Writer's Workbench system command do you want information?
.br
Type 
help
if you need a list.  Type
.B quit
to end this session.
.sp
At the prompt, type a command-name, help, or quit.
.br
=>
.PP
``=>'' is a prompt for you to type a Writer's Workbench system
.I command-name.
Suppose you type
.B proofr.
The program will next ask you to enter a 
.I topic.
(Your choices are:  
.BR "bugs, description, example, index, options, format," " and " "uses" ".)"
If you chose 
.B description
as your
.I topic,
the program would respond by  printing a short passage
describing the 
.I proofr 
program.
Requests for other 
.I topics
and other Writer's Workbench
system command-names
will be handled similarly.
Typing 
.B quit
will end the session.
.PP
You can type the word 
.B all
as your response to a request for a 
.I topic
and as a response to a request for a 
.I command-name,
or as a response to both.
You will get:
.IP a)
all information on one command, if you type
.B all
instead of a 
.I topic.
.IP b)
all commands on one topic, if you type
.B all
instead of a
.I command-name.
.IP c)
all information on all commands, if you type
.B "all all" .
.PP
When you have become familiar with the Writer's Workbench system
and the user's aid,
you may want to use a more direct route to information.
.PP
For example, the command:
.PP
.ce 3
.B "wwbaid index all"
.sp
or
.sp
.B "wwbaid i all"
.PP
will print the complete index, and then exit.
.PP
Since every detail about the Writer's Workbench system
cannot be covered by the user's aid,
the command:
.PP
.ce
.B "wwbaid map"
.PP
will print a list of papers, reprints of talks, 
and related references about the Writer's Workbench system.
.PP
Whenever you need a memory-jogger, type 
.PP
.ce
.B wwbaid
.PP
for a list of the user's aid commands.
