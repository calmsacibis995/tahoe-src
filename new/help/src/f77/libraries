.TI F77/LIBRARIES "Sep. 15, 1984"
System Libraries for Fortran Users

F77plot is an interface library which allows f77 users to access
the UNIX graphics routines; see "help f77 plotting" and "man 3f plot"
for more information.

The f77 system libraries provide the standard Fortran I/O facilities
and mathematical intrinsics; in addition there is a variety of
mathematical routines, bit manipulation routines, etc.
See "man 3f intro" for a description of the non-standard routines.

IMSL and NAG are large libraries of numerical routines.  They are
not part of the standard Bell Labs or Berkeley distributions;
rather each site acquires them independently.  Check with your
system administrator as to whether your site has either of them.
See "help f77 imsl_lib" and "help f77 nag_lib" for more information
on those libraries.
