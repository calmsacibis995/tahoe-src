Introduction to the f77 Fortran Compiler

This help file is an introduction to the use of Fortran on the
VAX UNIX systems.  For a more tutorial introduction, see "help f77
tutorial".

Source files for the f77 compiler must have filenames ending in ".f".
To compile and load a program with source contained in the file 'prog.f',
type "f77 prog.f". Two files will be created in your directory:

.nf
	prog.o		The compiled, relocatable object file.
	a.out		The loaded, executable binary file.
.fi

To run the program, type "a.out".
The general f77 command for source in several files is:

	f77 prog.f sub1.f sub2.f ... subn.f

This command will compile all the named ".f" files (creating a ".o" file for
each) and load all the object files together into a single executable file
called 'a.out'.

To save time, object files that don't need to be recompiled may be substituted
for the corresponding source files in the command above.  For example, if
prog.f and sub2.f have been changed since they were compiled, but the other
source files have not been changed since last compiled, type:

	f77 prog.f sub1.o sub2.f sub3.o ... subn.o

If all the files ending in '.o' and '.f' in this directory are part of this
program, you could simplify this to:

	f77 prog.f sub2.f *.o
