.TI F77/TAPES "Sep. 4, 1985"
Using magnetic tapes with f77 programs

Fortran logical units may be used for disk files, but not generally
for reading and writing magnetic tapes.
For magnetic tapes, use the special routines described in "man 3f topen".
A sample program to read an unblocked tape is in "help f77 tp_ex1.f",
a sample to read a blocked tape is in "help f77 tp_ex2.f".
They are set up to get the device name from the environment variable 'tape1'.

To save the help file in a file of your own, use the help '>' command,
i.e. at the help prompt, type:

	tp_ex1.f > myfile.f

If you need to rerun the program, to rewind the tape, either use
the trewin() function (see "man 3f topen") or use:

	mt -t $tape1 rew

or use the UNIX "rewind" command.
