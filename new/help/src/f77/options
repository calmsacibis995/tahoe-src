.TI F77/OPTIONS "June 15, 1985"
Options for the f77 Compiler and the Loader

See "man f77" and "man ld" for a complete list of options.  These are the
most commonly used options:

.nf
	-C	generate execution time subscript bounds checking
	-O	optimize (somewhat) the object code
	-w	suppress all warning messages
	-w66	suppress warning messages regarding Fortran 66
			compatibility
	-c	compile only; don't load
	-g	save the symbol table for the symbolic debugger, dbx,
			load special subroutines in case dbx is used
			interactively, and cause core to be dumped
			on errors
	-p	generate code to perform execution time profiling
			by the 'prof' command
	-pg	generate code to perform execution time profiling
			by the 'gprof' command - this is more
			extensive than -p and 'prof'
	-q	suppress printing file and program unit names during
			compilation
	-o fn	save the executable in 'fn' instead of in 'a.out'
	-M	load map: the loader prints out each file scanned
			and which files are loaded from archives
	-l<lib> scan the indicated system library, e.g. -lf77plot
			causes /usr/lib/libf77plot.a, the f77 graphics
			interface library, to be scanned during loading
			and any needed object files in that library
			are loaded
.fi

The -C, -O, -w, -w66, -q, and -c options are directed to the compiler; -l, -o,
and -M are directed to the loader, and -g, -p, -pg must be specified to both.
Thus:

.nf
	f77 -c -g -p -C prog.f
	f77    -g -p    prog.o -lf77plot -o myprog
.fi

is equivalent to:

	f77 -g -p -C prog.f -lf77plot -o myprog
