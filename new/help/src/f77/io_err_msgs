.Er 100 "error in format"
See error message output for the location
of the error in the format. Can be caused
by more than 10 levels of nested parentheses, or
an extremely long format statement.

.Er 101 "illegal unit number"
It is illegal to close logical unit 0.
Unit numbers must be between 0 and 99 inclusive.

.Er 102 "formatted i/o not allowed"
The logical unit was opened for
unformatted I/O.

.Er 103 "unformatted i/o not allowed"
The logical unit was opened for
formatted I/O.

.Er 104 "direct i/o not allowed"
The logical unit was opened for sequential
access, or the logical record length was
specified as 0.

.Er 105 "sequential i/o not allowed"
The logical unit was opened for direct
access I/O.

.Er 106 "can't backspace file"
The file associated with the logical unit
can't seek. May be a device or a pipe.

.Er 107 "off beginning of record"
The format specified a left tab beyond the
beginning of an internal input record.

.Er 108 "can't stat file"
The system can't return status information
about the file. Perhaps the directory is
unreadable.

.Er 109 "no * after repeat count"
Repeat counts in list-directed I/O must be
followed by an * with no blank spaces.

.Er 110 "off end of record"
A formatted write tried to go beyond the
logical end-of-record. An unformatted read
or write will also cause this.

.Er 111 "truncation failed"
The truncation of an external sequential file on
``close'', ``backspace'', ``rewind'' or ``endfile'' failed.

.Er 112 "incomprehensible list input"
List input has to be just right.

.Er 113 "out of free space"
The library dynamically creates buffers for
internal use. You ran out of memory for this.
Your program is too big!

.Er 114 "unit not connected"
The logical unit was not open.

.Er 115 "invalid data for integer format term"
Only spaces, a leading sign and digits are allowed.

.Er 116 "invalid data for logical format term"
Legal input consists of spaces (optional), a period (optional), and then
a ``t'', ``T'', ``f'', or ``F''.

.Er 117 "\(fmnew\(fm file exists"
You tried to open an existing file with
"status=\(fmnew\(fm".

.Er 118 "can't find \(fmold\(fm file"
You tried to open a non-existent file
with "status=\(fmold\(fm".

.Er 119 "opening too many files or unknown system error"
Either you are trying to open too many files
simultaneously or there has been an undetected system error.

.Er 120 "requires seek ability"
Direct access requires seek ability.
Sequential unformatted I/O requires seek
ability on the file due to the special
data structure required. Tabbing left
also requires seek ability.

.Er 121 "illegal argument"
Certain arguments to 'open', etc. will be
checked for legitimacy. Often only non-
default forms are looked for.

.Er 122 "negative repeat count"
The repeat count for list directed input
must be a positive integer.

.Er 123 "illegal operation for unit"
An operation was requested for a device
associated with the logical unit which
was not possible. This error is returned
by the tape I/O routines if attempting to
read past end-of-tape, etc.

.Er 124 "invalid data for d,e,f or g format term"
Input data must be legal.

.Er 125 "illegal input for namelist"
Column one of input is ignored, the namelist name must match,
the variables must be in the namelist,
and the data must be of the right type.
