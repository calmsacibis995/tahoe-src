.TI F77/ONLINE_DOC "Sep. 4, 1985"
On-line Documentation

For a list of Fortran related help files, see "help f77 general".
For a tutorial introduction to f77, see "help f77 tutorial"; for a
more advanced introduction, see "help f77 intro" and "help f77 options".

Relevant manual pages include:

.nf
	man f77		the compiler
	man dbx		the source level debugger
	man fsplit	a utility to split programs into one
				subprogram/file
	man make	program maintenance system (source &
				object)
	man ld		the loader
	man ar		ar + ranlib are used in making libraries
	man ranlib	ar + ranlib are used in making libraries
.fi

Use "apropos" ("man -k") to find manual entries about a topic,
For example, if you want to find out what manual pages talk about
debugging, type:

	apropos debug

the system responds:

.nf
	adb (1)			- debugger
	dbx (1)			- debugger
	pdx (1)			- pascal debugger
.fi

You could then type "man 1 adb" and "man 1 dbx" to see which one to
use with f77 (use dbx) and how to use it.

Similarly "apropos library libraries" lists all the manual entries with
the words 'library' or 'libraries' in their title lines.
