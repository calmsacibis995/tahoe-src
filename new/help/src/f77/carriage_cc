.TI F77/CARRIAGE_CC "Sep. 4, 1985"
Fortran Carriage Control with f77

Normally no special processing of carriage control characters is
done by the f77 I/O library.  Two ways to get carriage
control character processing are to open the output file with "form=print":

	open( unit=6, form='print' )

or use the fpr filter on the output:

	a.out | fpr

Both of these will single space for a blank in column one,
double space for a '0' in column one, and replace a '1' in column
one by a form feed to skip to a new page.

With "form=print", any other character appearing in column one,
including '+', is deleted with no effect on vertical spacing.

With fpr, the effects of '+' (overprinting) are simulated using backspaces.
Characters in column one that are not recognized as carriage control
characters are printed in column one.  If there were any invalid carriage
control characters, before ending, fpr writes out how many invalid
carriage control characters there were.
