Plotting and Graphics

The Fortran callable graphics routines are described in "man 3f plot".
These are primitive routines for plotting points, lines, arcs,
and text.  They are designed to work with graphics terminals.

From Fortran, printer plots can be made using several IMSL subroutines
in chapter U of the IMSL manual.  Those routines print horizontal
and vertical histograms and graph functions.

The UNIX graph command (see "man 1g graph") reads data from a file to
plot points and lines and can be used with the same
devices as the basic plotting routines mentioned above.

S, a statistical package available on some UNIX systems,
includes some graphics capabilities. 

One way to use graph or S is to run the Fortran program
writing the output to a file and then run the graphics package.
The graphics packages can also be run reading the output of the
Fortran program from a pipe.
Another way is to call the package at appropriate times during
the execution of the Fortran program using the subroutine system(), as in:

.nf
      open(8,file='plotin')
         ... code writing to file plotin
      close(8)
      call system('graph plotin | plot -T4014')
.fi
