The following documents may be purchased at the Computing Services
library, 218 Evans Hall, U.C. Berkeley, Berkeley, California 94720, 
(415) 642-5205.  New users should start with "Communicating with UNIX",
"Edit: a Tutorial" and then "A Guide for VAX UNIX Fortran Users".

.Xp
"Communicating with UNIX", Nov. 1984, Ricki Blau, Jane Wolff,
UNX 1.3.1, 22 pages.
An introduction to UNIX for new users.  Designed to
be used with "Edit: a Tutorial".

.Xp
"Edit: a Tutorial", Sept. 1984, Ricki Blau, James Joyce, Jane Wolff,
UNX 3.3.1, 30 pages.  An introduction to the UNIX editor, 'edit', for new
users.

.Xp
"A Guide for VAX UNIX Fortran Users", March 1985, Jerry Berkman,
UNX 2.3.3, 70 pages.  This assembles in one place
a variety of information relevant to f77 use that is otherwise
scattered throughout the UNIX documentation.  It includes many
example programs, and explains how best to write, maintain, and
debug Fortran programs on UNIX.
It also includes the material in the f77 help files.
Although some of the information is specific to UC Berkeley,
most of the information is of general interest.

.Xp
"An Introduction to the C shell", Nov. 1980, William Joy, UNX 1.3.10,
46 pages.  An extensive discussion of the C shell command
interpreter.  This covers more advanced material than
"Communicating with UNIX".

.Xp
"A Portable Fortran 77 Compiler", Sept. 1985,  S. I. Feldman and
P. J. Weinberger, UNX 2.2.10, 25 pages.  This is a reference
document that describes f77 by listing the differences between
the language it compiles and the 1977 and 1966 Fortran standards.
It is a terse document, not intended for beginners.

.Xp
"Make - A Program for Maintaining Computer Programs", Aug 1978, S. I. Feldman,
UNX 11.2.2, 9 pages.  This reference for the 'make' program
maintenance system is written for C programmer's. As a Fortran
programmer, you are better off starting with "help f77 make"
and "help f77 style" or with the description of 'make' in
"A Guide for VAX UNIX Fortran Users".

.Xp
"Introduction to the f77 I/O Library", Sept., 1985, David L. Wasley, 11 pages.
This is a technical description of the f77 I/O library.

.LP
All except for "Communicating ..." and "A Guide ..." are
part of Vol. 2C of the "VAX UNIX Programmer's Manual".
