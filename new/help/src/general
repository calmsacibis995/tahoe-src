Introduction to Help
.sp 2
The Unix "help" command displays documentation on various topics.
If you type

	help

from the Unix shell, you will see a list of the major topics that
help knows about and a set of instructions for perusing them.
If one of the topics were "topic", you could skip directly to
information relating to "topic" by typing

	help topic

from the shell, and after seeing the documentation you would be
returned directly to the shell.

The help topics are intended to provide Unix documentation
written for inexperienced users, as well as coverage of various
non-standard features of the local Unix system.

Another command that displays on-line information is "man",
which shows you the section from the Unix Programmer's Manual
for a particular command or system feature.
The documentation it produces is terse and difficult, and,
if used correctly, comprehensive.
To see the manual page for the "ls" command, for example, type

	man ls

Help has several indexes in which to look for subjects you request.
They help you locate references to help, man, and off-line documentation.
To find out briefly what each topic is about, type "index_help"
(no quotation marks) as a topic.
