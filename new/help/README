The -m maintenance options are very incomplete and are not worth
relying on.  The C shell topics are incomplete.  Many topics were
not included because there was no time to edit out all the local
color and mistakes.  Where no mistakes were perceived the local
stuff was left alone if it was deemed interesting.
