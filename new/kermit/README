The files in this directory represent the Unix version 4C(057) of Kermit as
of 7/31/85.  All other versions are available from Columbia University by means
described below.  Their brochure and order form follow.  The file ckaaaa.hlp
describes the other files in this directory.

This is the Columbia University Kermit brochure and order form as of June 1985.
If a lot of time has passed since then, chances are that it will be obsolete,
in which case you should inquire at the address below or call 212-280-3703 to
find out if the terms and conditions have changed, or whether any new systems
have been added to the list of those supported by Kermit.

                       THE KERMIT FILE TRANSFER PROTOCOL

                                   June 1985



Kermit is a protocol for transferring sequential files between computers of all
sizes over ordinary asynchronous telecommunication lines using packets,  check-
sums, and retransmission to promote data integrity.  Kermit is non-proprietary,
thoroughly documented, and in wide use.  The  protocol  and  the  original  im-
plementations  were  developed at Columbia University and have been shared with
many other institutions, some of which have made significant  contributions  of
their  own.  Kermit is presently available for more than 100 different machines
and operating systems, and additional versions are  always  under  development.
Current implementations include:

  Unix (V7, 4.x BSD, System III, System V, Xenix, Venix, PC/IX; C language)
  Software Tools (various systems; Ratfor)

  Burroughs B6800, B7900 (Algol)
  Cray-1, Cray-XMP (CTSS; Fortran-77)
  CDC Cyber 170 (NOS, NOS/BE; Fortran-77)
  Data General Nova (RDOS; Fortran-5)
  Data General AOS (Fortran-5), AOS/VS (Pascal)
  DEC PDP-11 (RT11,RSX11M(+),RSTS,P/OS,TSX+; Macro-11), (MUMPS; MUMPS-11)
  DEC VAX-11 (VMS; Bliss-32 or Macro-32), (VMS; Pascal/Fortran)
  DECsystem-10 (TOPS-10; Bliss-36, Macro-10)
  DECSYSTEM-20 (TOPS-20; Macro-20)
  Harris 800 (VOS; Pascal)
  Honeywell (MULTICS; PL/I), DPS-6,8 (GCOS; C, B), CP6 (Pascal)
  Hewlett-Packard 1000 (RTE-6/VM; Fortran), HP3000 (MPE; SPL or Fortran)
  IBM 370-Series (VM/CMS, MVS/TSO, MVS/GUTS, MTS, MUSIC; Assembler)
  Perkin-Elmer 3200 Series (OS32; Fortran)
  PRIME (PRIMOS; PL/P)
  Sperry/Univac-1100 (EXEC; Assembler or Ratfor or Pascal)
  Tandem (Nonstop; TAL)

  CP/M-80 (about 20 different systems; ASM)
  CP/M-86 (DEC Rainbow, NEC APC, and several other systems; ASM86)
  MS-DOS, PC-DOS (IBM PC,XT,AT, DEC Rainbow, and many other systems; MASM)
  UCSD p-System (IBM PC, Terak, and other systems; Pascal)

  Alpha Micro 68000 (Alpha 68K Assembler)
  Apollo (Aegis; Pascal)
  Apple II 6502 (Apple DOS; DEC-10/20 CROSS or Apple Assembler)
  Apple Macintosh (SUMACC C)
  Atari (DOS; Action!)
  Commodore 64 (DEC-10/20 CROSS or FORTH)
  DEC Pro-300 Series (P/OS; Bliss-16 or Macro-11),(Pro/RT; Macro),(Venix; C)
  Intel Development System (ISIS; PL/M)
  NCR Tower (OS 1.02; C)
  Perq (Pascal)
  TRS80 Models I,III,4 (TRSDOS; ASM), Model 16 (Xenix; C), Color Computer (Asm)

The  IBM  mainframe Kermits work only with asynchronous TTY connections through
3705 or equivalent front ends.  The VM/CMS and MVS/TSO versions  also  have  an

option  to  allow file transfer through Series/1 or other front ends supporting
the Yale ASCII Communications System;  beyond  that  exception,  Kermit  cannot
transfer  files in the IBM synchronous 3270-style full screen terminal environ-
ment.

The Kermit software -- including source -- is furnished free, without  license,
and  with no restriction on copying or redistribution except that it should not
be sold for profit, and that any copyright notices must be left intact.   Under
certain  conditions  (described  in a separate document) software producers may
include Kermit protocol in their products.  Kermit software  and  documentation
is furnished without warranty of any kind, and neither Columbia University, nor
the individual  authors,  nor  any  institution  that  has  contributed  Kermit
material, acknowledge any liability for any claims arising from the use of Ker-
mit.

Although the Kermit software is free and unlicensed, Columbia University cannot
afford  to  distribute  it for free because the demand is too great.  To defray
our costs for media, printing, postage, labor, and computing resources, we  re-
quire  a  moderate distribution fee from those who request Kermit directly from
us.  The schedule is given on the Kermit Order Form.    Alternate  sources  for
Kermit material are listed below.

Kermit  is  distributed  by  Columbia University only on 9-track magnetic tape,
suitable for reading on most mainframe and minicomputers.  It is  assumed  that
Kermit  will  be  ordered in this form by institutional computer centers, whose
professional staff will  take  the  responsibility  for  ``bootstrapping''  the
microcomputer versions from the tape to diskettes for their users.

Documentation  includes the Kermit User Guide, which contains complete instruc-
tions for installing and using the major implementations of Kermit, the  Kermit
Protocol  Manual,  which is a guide for writing a new implementation of Kermit,
and the manuscript from the Kermit article that appeared in the June  and  July
1984 issues of BYTE Magazine.

Once you receive Kermit, you may redistribute it on your own terms, and are en-
couraged to do so, with the following stipulations: Kermit should not  be  sold
for  profit; credit should be given where it is due; and new material should be
sent back to Columbia University so that we can maintain a definitive and  com-
prehensive set of Kermit implementations for further distribution.

ALTERNATE SOURCES:

Kermit  is  also  available to users of the BITNET network via a server at host
CUVMA (BITNET users type ``SMSG RSCS  MSG  CUVMA  KERMSRV  HELP''  for  further
information);  the  Internet  (via  anonymous  FTP from host CU20B, in the area
KER:); UUCP from host okstate; and on magnetic tape from user groups like DECUS
and  SHARE.    IBM PC-format MS-DOS Kermit floppies can be ordered from PC-SIG,
Santa Clara CA, (408) 730-9291.
                             ORDERING INFORMATION

There are two separate Kermit tapes, A and B. As of June  1985  there  are  too
many Kermit files to fit on a single tape.  All tapes are half-inch, 2400-foot,
9-track, 1600bpi, odd parity.  They are available ONLY in  the  following  for-
mats:

  ANSI:   ANSI labeled ASCII, format D (variable length records)
  TAR:    UNIX TAR format (written on a VAX with 4.2bsd or Ultrix-32)
  OS:     IBM OS standard labeled EBCDIC, format VB (variable length records)
  CMS:    IBM CMS Tape Dump format (unlabeled)
  DEC-10: DECsystem-10 Backup/Interchange format (unlabeled)
  DEC-20: DECSYSTEM-20 DUMPER format (unlabeled)

Blocksizes,  when  applicable,  are our choice and will be in the range 2K-10K.
NO OTHER FORMATS ARE AVAILABLE.  We can  NOT  make  800bpi  or  6250bpi  tapes,
7-track  tapes,  unlabeled tapes (except as noted above), fixed-block tapes, or
custom tapes of any kind.  If none of the above formats looks familiar to  you,
then  specify  ANSI -- this is an industry standard format that should be read-
able by any computer system.  VAX/VMS sites should specify ANSI.

Tapes include machine readable source for both programs and documentation.

TAPE ``A'' CONTAINS:

   - The microcomputer (PC, workstation) Kermit implementations
   - The Kermit User Guide
   - The Kermit Protocol Manual
   - The Info-Kermit mail archive,
   - Other documentation of a general nature

TAPE ``B'' CONTAINS:

   - The mainframe and minicomputer Kermit implementations.

EXCEPTIONS:

   - Macintosh Kermit is one of the  implementations  generated  from  the
     C-Kermit  sources, which are collected on tape B. A duplicate copy of
     the Macintosh hex and doc files is also included on tape A  for  con-
     venience.

   - While  the general documentation is on tape A, any documentation of a
     specific  nature  is  distributed  together  with  the   program   it
     describes.
