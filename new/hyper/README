This is an initial distribution of a working 4.2bsd version of the
Hyperchannel driver.

Changes from the one distributed with 4.2 include:

	- it works
	- ioctl was redone cause 4.2 limits the argument to 128 bytes
	- better support for powerfail detection.
	- route table now supports adapter loopback and remote end
	  A710 loopback
	- an untested interface that should allow RAW packets to be
	  sent is provided.  If you use it, let me know so I can
	  incorporate any required bug fixes into it.
	- if you ifconfig the device if cleans out the send queue
	  for the device (e.g. it gets it "unstuck" and kicks the
	  state machine).

The driver just got installed on one of our 780s on 5/8/84.
It's getting currently being installed on a couple of other 780s.
The company will be switching to it as machines convert to 4.2 bsd.
I've also tried it on a 750.

NOTE:  This driver assumes that you have installed the ARP modifications
posted to net.sources by Bill Shannon @ Sun.  The changes are simple (in
if.c) and only affect the hyioctl routine.
