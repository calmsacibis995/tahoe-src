bsmall - the small B interpreter.

This directory contains the sources of a version of the B interpreter
that may run on a PDP-11 with separate I and D space.  It is not very
useful, since creating a table or list of a few hundred elements already
overflows the system's memory.  Also we don't support this version.
In fact, it is an old version of the full system. It uses a straigth linear
representation for texts, lists and tables, and finite length arithmetic
for the numerics.

This version supports the "BTOP" mode of the editor, and with many features
turned off, the editor will also fit on a PDP-11, so for demonstration 
purposes the system looks the same as the big system (except for speed).
However, this was a quick add-on, and not thoroughly tested.
