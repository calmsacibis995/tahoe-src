bed - the B editor.

Here are the sources for the B editor.

The editor uses the termcap library for output to the terminal.
The editor uses rather advanced terminal features, not all of which are
supported by termcap. If your terminal has all sorts of nice
features that the termcap database doesn't know about, try to get your
system administrator or guru to fix the database. This is really worth the
trouble, before you start to fiddle with the editor's sources.

If there are any other problems, consult the beditor(5) manual entry
in ../../../man/man5/beditor.5.
