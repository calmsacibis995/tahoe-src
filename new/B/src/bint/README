bint - the B interpreter.

The sources are divided into three coarse layers:
    b1*: the B virtual machine, implementing all primitive actions on values
    b2*: parser, parse-tree displayer, and parse-tree 'fixer' (disambiguater)
    b3*: interpreter and main program.

Most machine dependent changes are generated automatically by mkconfig
into mkconfig.h, and should not require any manual interference.
Other machine and operating-system dependencies are localised in the
configuration files b0con.h (which includes mkconfig.h at the end),
the interface with interrupts b3sig.c, and the file-system interface
b3fil.c.

Only one other comment.
Some Unix systems have a rather inaccurate log function.
However, for copyright reasons, we can't distribute the whole routine fixed,
but only the fix itself. This is as follows.

If your log contains the line

	static double	p2	= -.963769093368686593e1;
it should be replaced by
	static double	p2	= -.963769093377840513e1;
	                                      ^^^^^^^^
