ex	example B workspaces.

doc	documentation.

lib	place to install auxiliary files and binaries within B file system.

man	manuals.

src	sources for the B system.

src/b

# README's and MAKEFILE's
#

All source directories have README and Makefile files.
These Makefiles accept the following entry points:

make install	build new version of a program or library and install it
		together with auxiliary files in ./bin or ./lib.

make clean	remove unnecessary files that can easily be rebuilt.

make print	print sources, documentation or manuals.

#
# generic files
#

Most source Makefile's and src/b/b.sh and src/b/b_p.sh are generated
from generic copies by ./Setup. If you need to edit any of these and
still be able to run ./Setup later, you must edit the xx.gen generic
version of the file, and install it by running ./Setup.
