HOW'TO TRY the B editor:

The directory B/ex/try is here to try the B editor interactively.  The
example B workspace here can always be regenerated with:

        cd  ../generate
        cp  \'*  ../try
        cd  ../try

Now enter the B system from this directory with

        ../../bin/b

After the B system has started up it will prompt for a command with

        >>> ?

Slowly type `s', then `t', (no capitals needed) and you should see the B
editor suggest the SELECT and START commands, respectively.  Now
press [TAB] to accept this last suggestion, and [RETURN] to enter the
START command to the B interpreter.  This command will promt you for
input, with

        ?

Just enter about four lines of text, (which will be echoed), ending with an
empty one (press [RETURN] immediately).  A short `poem' should be generated
by the B interpreter.

If you are already familiar with the B language, you might try to edit the
START unit by answering

        >>> ?

with

        :START

For example, try to remove the SET'RANDOM command, to get random
results on the same input.  Or make the unit delay the echoing of the text,
entered by the user, until after the reading of the empty line.  For test-
ing purposes you should at least try the arrow keys to move the focus
around.

You can undo any change by pressing [BACKSPACE].
You can get help with ?.
You can leave the B editor with control-X.
You can leave `b' by typing QUIT.

For more information, see the manual pages `B(1)' and `bterminal(5)', and
the User's Guide.

See the B Newsletter, issue 2, for a description of the `generate' program.

If there are any problems with the editor, consult the `bterminal(5)'
manual entry before trying anything else.
