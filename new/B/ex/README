The subdirectories here represent B work spaces, with example B units.

With 'make examples', the B interpreter in ../lib/bint is tested (via the
shell command '../bin/b') on the following four examples:

	generate	generates new sentences based on those supplied
			by the user;
	hanoi		the towers of hanoi;
	pi		calculates the value of pi, using the unbounded
			arithmetic of B;
	xref		a cross reference generator.

For more information on these programs, see the B Newsletter, Issue 2.

When you are on a small system, '../lib/bsmall' is used as the B interpreter.
Because the output of the examples is different in this case, you should use
'make smallexamples' to test it. The pi example will not work at all, because
bsmall uses bounded arithmetic.

The B editor ../lib/bed can only be tested by calling ../bin/b interactively.
For this the 'try' work space has been created from the 'generate' example,
so you can always regenerate it. For more information see the README in ./try.
