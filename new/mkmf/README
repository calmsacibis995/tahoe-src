Description:

The mkmf makefile editor creates  program and library  makefiles for the
UNIX make command (UNIX is a trademark of Bell  Telephone  Laboratories,
Inc.).  Mkmf has the following features:

    - Automatically inserts source and object code file names in
      makefiles

    - Provides standard makefile templates for programs and libraries

    - Allows user-defined makefile templates

    - Generates include file dependencies for C, Pascal, and Fortran
      source code

    - Allows arbitrary editing of makefiles with a regular text editor

Installation:

1.	Set up directories  /usr/new,  /usr/new/lib,  and /usr/man/mann.
	These  must  be writable by the installing process.  If you want
	to put mkmf somewhere else,  you will have to change  the  DEST=
	macro in all the makefiles, and edit the "spms.h" file.

2.	Change  to  the  mkmf  directory  and  execute   "make install".
	If something  goes  wrong, don't panic. Just fix the problem and
	restart "make install".

Bugfixes/Changes:

1.	Mkmf was previously part of the SPMS Software Project Management
	System. It is now completely independent.

2.	Mkmf now searches for include files in the directory  containing
	the  file  currently  being  processed,  rather than the current
	working directory. This only affects nested include files  which
	are external to the current working directory.
3.	Mkmf now reads multiple -I options in  CFLAGS  and  FFLAGS  cor-
	rectly.

4.	Mkmf can now process the example  presented  by  Kim  Walden  in
	Software-Practice and Experience,  vol. 14,  no. 6, pp. 575-585,
	June 1984.
