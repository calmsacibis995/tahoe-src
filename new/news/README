Warning: The compression scheme provided here is not compatible with the
2.10.2 version. You must get all the sites you communicate with to run
this version of unbatch.c. Otherwise, your compressed news will
be thrown away. On the otherhand, you no longer need to have cunbatch
on the remote system.

Compress V4.0 is provided with this release. It is not compatible with
the 2.0 compress, however, if the -C flag is given to sendbatch, compress
will generate V2.0 output. This program can decompress either format 
automatically.

Note that sendbatch -c  has replaced csendbatch. sendbatch now takes
several flags. See the man page for details.

Disclaimer:

This release (2.11/11 4.3bsd) is for the 4.3Absd tape. The code is known
to work on 4.[123]bsd vaxes. It seems works on USG  & V7 systems but has not
been extensively tested. There are certainly problems on Eunice systems.
DO NOT use this with VMS defined, you will regret it.

In any case, please mail me any problems you have.
