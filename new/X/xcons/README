This program may be convenient on the QDSS, where you may want a
convenient way to get console output into the login window.  It is 
intended to be invoked something like

	xcons qdcons ttyv0

where "qdcons" is whatever you call the console-redirect device, and "ttyv0"
is whatever tty the login window uses.  The argument order is "backwards"
because it is really intended to be run from init, with an /etc/ttys line
of the form:

qdcons		"/etc/xcons ttyv0" none on

This is the way we now have it running on our machines.
