This is version X10/6.6B of xterm, the VT102/Tektronix 4014 terminal emulator.
This version has many bug fixes to the 6.6A and 6.6A2 version from MIT.  Most
notable differences is that titlebar and active icon are off now by default,
so -tb means turn on the titlebar (like in previous versions).  The -bi option
has been replace with the -ai (turn on active icon).

Precompiled version of xterm 6.6B are available in the EXECUTABLES directory
for the MicroVax, Sun 3 and RT/PC.
