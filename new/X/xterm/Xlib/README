This directory contains a changes to the Xlib routines XKeyBind.c:

XKeyBind.c:	This will allow (in the future) to define keymaps with
		the environment variable KEYBD.  This is needed, for example,
		when I log into a Sun from some other workstation.  Then, on
		the Sun, I wish to pop a window back on my workstation.  Since
		the default keymap would be for the Sun, if I were on some
		other workstation, my keyboard would be messed up.  I could
		keep a .Xkeymap file on the Sun, but if I use different
		workstations to log in, sometimes it might work and other times
		it wouldn't.  If I were originally on a MicroVax and set
		my KEYBD environment variable (from the .login file) to
		mvaxII, for instance, then I would get the right keymap.  From
		another Sun, I might set KEYBD to sun3.  The names of these
		keymap files have not yet been established yet.
