Init can now be used to maintain arbitrary daemons besides terminal lines,
restarting them after exit automatically.

Do not forget to add the termcap and/or terminfo entries found in
xterm's source directory to /etc/termcap or /etc/term.

Note that the file format of /etc/ttys changes radically (for the better).
You must also add the Vs100 entry to your /etc/gettytab file, so that
getty can do the correct things for your login window.
