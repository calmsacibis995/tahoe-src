	Changes from release 3 to release 4 of X

There is device dependent code for the Apollo, Integrated Solutions,
and IBM RT/PC displays.  The Sun implementation has been improved,
but is not yet complete.  The IBM RT/PC implementation has a
reasonably complete implementation which could be used to fill out
the Sun graphics implementation, but we had no manpower to do so.

Release 4 of the system will be the LAST based on Version 10 of the
X protocol.

New:
	libapollo	device dependent code for Apollo workstations
			Our thanks to the Mark Swanson at the
			University of Utah and Doug Orr for this work.
			Due to problems in Apollo's preprocessor,
			installation may be painful.

	libibm		device dependent code for IBM RT/PC
			workstation.  Our thanks to Daniel Stone,
			Mike Braca, Dave Bundy at Brown University
			IRIS for this work. NOTE: This runs under
			IBM ACIS 4.2 Release 2 ONLY, not under AIX.
			
	libsun		device dependent code for the SUN workstations.
			Thanks to Paul Borman of Cray Research for the
			latest keyboard fixes.

	libis		device dependent code for Integrated Solutions
			display.

	xtrek		addictive game; requires shared memory, so not
			all machines can run it, though all can participate.
			Blame Chris Guthrie (chris@ic.berkeley.edu).

	showimg		nice imageing program for color displays. 
			primarily here to give examples.

	xcolors		program to help figure out what colors to use

	xperfmon	performance monitor for Unix.
	
	Toolkit		3 user interface toolkits for prototyping
			purposes.  Thanks to John Osterhaut at Berkeley
			for Sx, Frank Hall's Corvallis Workstation Group
			in Hewlett-Packard for Xrlib and Ram Rao's
			engineering group in DEC for DECToolkit.

Improved:

	X		Bug fixes.  Not many, as server is very stable.
			Stipple fill, but not really blessed, as not
			available everywhere.

	Xlib		A few bug fixes, a few new routines.

	xterm		major new version courtesy of Ed Moy at Berkeley.
			Can you say "Kitchen Sink"?  Scrollbars,
			titlebars, 4015 emulation, etc.

	doc/Xlib	bug fixes.

	doc/Paper	TOG paper on X.  Explains much that has been
			obscure.

	man/*		updated for new arguments.

	XMenu		bug fixes in callback stuff.

	bitmap		line, circle drawing added.

	xwd xwud	improved to deal with color better.  No longer
			stores images off screen, so works all the
			time on implementations with little offscreen memory.



Enjoy!
