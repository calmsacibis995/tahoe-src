	The files in this directory are for use under the X window system to 
	preview files destined for printing on an IMAGEN laser printer. In
	addition there are several utilities to manage spool files, however
	the default settings of the site.h  and Makefile do not use spooling.

   NB: What folllows is the only way to do it right now with the make file 
	I have included.

HOW TO INSTALL:
1) Read the site.h and Makefile and edit them to make any needed local changes.

   If your troff is targeted for an IMAGEN 8/300 the IMAGEN300 flag in site.h
   should be turned on.

2) Just:
		make install-ns
	- This will make the previewer `impv' and install it in /usr/local
		make install-man
	- This will put ximpv.1 in  the /usr/man/man1 directory.
	  This completes the installation.

3) Try:
		make ximpv-test
	- This should cause ximpv to give you a preview of the file
	  test.man.data in this directory.  The key pad and controls
	  for ximpv should work as described in the man page.

		ximpv test.eqn.data 
	- This should cause ximpv to show you a page of equations.
	

Compiler Flags:
       -the XWIND flag in the #ifdef's of this directory is for 
	work with a VAX station. If the XWIND flag is not used this 
	software is designed to work on an Sun workstation.
       -the COLOR flag is needed to include the color slide option. 
	It is incompatible with the XWIND (even the color versions).
	Leaving it out does nothing to improve speed but decreases the
	code size by a small amount. It is not intended for the XWIND.
       -the NOSPOOL flag is for use if the spooling directories described
        above are not in use.  You may wish to rcp a file that is the product
        of dimp to the preview workstation and then preview it directly.
       -the IMAGEN300 flag is for used with files aimed at the imagen300 
        printer.
