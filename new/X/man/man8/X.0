NAME
     X - X window system server

SYNOPSIS
     X <display> [ option ... ] <tty>

DESCRIPTION
     _X is the window system server.  It is normally run automati-
     cally by _i_n_i_t(_8), which provides the tty argument.  The
     display argument is the number of the bitmap display to ser-
     vice.  The number is typically in the range 0-6, and defines
     the ports the server will accept connections on and the
     filename of the device.

     The program _x_i_n_i_t(_8) is  usually used to start X interac-
     tively.

     Connections through the Unix domain, through TCP, and
     through DECnet are currently possible.  The connections
     actually accepted by a server depend on how it was compiled.
     Unix domain connections are through /_d_e_v/_X*, where * is the
     display number.  TCP connections are through ports 5800+N
     (VAX byte order) and 5900+N (68000 byte order), where N is
     the display number.  DECnet connections are through object
     name ``X*'', where * is the display number.


     OPTIONS

     See the _X(_1) manual page for a list of command line options.


     INITIALIZATION

     _X(_1) and your first _x_t_e_r_m(_1) are normally started by the
     _i_n_i_t(_8) program.

     A typical line in /_e_t_c/_t_t_y_s might be:

	  ttyv0 "/etc/xterm -L =-1+1 :0" xterm on secure window="/etc/Xvs100 0 -c -l"

     However, if you want the xterm to run on a different
     machine, you might have:

	  remote "/etc/X 0 -l -c" xterm on secure

     on the server machine and

	  ttyv0 "/exe/xterm -L =-1+1 orpheus:0" xterm on secure

     on the client machine.

     _X maintains an access control list for accepting connec-
     tions.  The host where the server runs is initially on the
     list.  In addition, hosts listed the file /_e_t_c/_X*._h_o_s_t_s,
     where * is the display number, are also initially on the
     list.  The format of this file is a list of host names, one
     per line.	DECnet hosts are distinguished from Internet
     hosts by the existance of a trailing ``::'' in the name. The
     access control list can be manipulated with _x_h_o_s_t(_1).

     _X will catch the SIGHUP signal sent by _i_n_i_t(_8) after the
     initial process (usually the login _x_t_e_r_m(_1)) started on the
     display terminates.  This signal causes all connections to
     be closed (thereby ``disowning'' the terminal), all
     resources to be freed, and all defaults restored.

     The X protocol is documented in ``X.doc''.  Note that while
     X is running, all access to the display must be through the
     window system.

SEE ALSO
     X(1), xinit(1), xterm(1), bitmap(1), xwm(1), xhost(1),
     xload(1), xset(1), qv(4), vs(4), init(8)

DIAGNOSTICS
     Are too numerous to list them all.  If run from _i_n_i_t(_8),
     errors are logged in the file /_u_s_r/_a_d_m/_X*_m_s_g_s, where * is
     the display number.  Otherwise, errors go to error output.

     `fatal error: No such device or address at Opening' usually
     means someone else (like an existing X) has the display
     open.

     `fatal error: No such file or directory at Initializing'
     usually means the VS100 firmware was not found or that the
     device file for the display does not exist.

FILES
     /etc/X*.hosts	     Initial access control list
     /usr/new/lib/X/font     VS100/QVSS font directory
     /usr/new/lib/X/s-code   VS100 firmware directory
     /dev/vs*		     VS100 devices
     /dev/qd*		     QDSS devices
     /dev/mouse              QVSS device
     /dev/X*		     Unix domain socket (if configured)
     /usr/adm/X*msgs	     Error log file

BUGS
     The option syntax is inconsistent with itself and _x_s_e_t(_1).

     If _X dies before its clients, new clients won't be able to
     connect until all existing connections have their TCP
     TIME_WAIT timers expire.
