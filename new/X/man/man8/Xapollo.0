NAME
     Xapollo - X window system Apollo implementation notes

DESCRIPTION
     The Apollo X server can be started as a command to /bin/csh.
     It requires two arguments, both of which should be 0.  Nor-
     mally, however, the server should be started by invoking
     _x_i_n_i_t(1).

     The device dependent portion of the server is implemented
     using GPR system calls, and is known to work on DN300,
     DN330, DN560, DN660, and DN3000 systems,  all running SR9.2.

BUGS
     Restrictions in the current implementation:

     -	  Brush shapes are ignored and all result in 1x1 brush.

     -	  The labelled control and shift keys do not affect the
	  mouse buttons;  the keys LD, LE, and LF have been
	  pressed into service to provide control, meta, and
	  shift, respectively, for the mouse buttons.  The "POP"
	  key also serves as a general meta key.  Should the
	  server become "wedged", typing shift F8 will terminate
	  the server.

     -	  Apollo fonts impose restrictions on the number of char-
	  acters (127) and their maximum size;	thus, some fonts
	  cannot be converted to Apollo format and performance
	  using them is badly degraded.  Those fonts that can be
	  converted to Apollo format should be converted using
	  the cvtfont program.

     -	  XY masks (for defining non-rectangular clipping regions
	  or "stencils") are not implemented.

     -	  No SHIFT LOCK key is implementd.

     -	  Only down events are available for the standard "print-
	  able" keys.

     -	  Up- and Down-events for the normal Control and Shift
	  keys are simulated, as these keys do not correspond to
	  separate GPR events.

     -	  The csh invoking xinit should not have inprocess set.
	  This will cause the initial xterm process to hang.
