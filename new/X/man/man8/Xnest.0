NAME
     Xnest - Recursive X window system implementation

DESCRIPTION
     This implementation allows you to run an X server in a win-
     dow of another X server.  Full functionality is supported.
     The number of planes provided by this pseudo-device is the
     same as the underlying device.  The cursor sizes, tile
     sizes, and brush sizes supported are also the same.  The
     number of color cells provided is specified with a ._X_d_e_-
     _f_a_u_l_t_s option.

     Aside from being a good hack, this implementation exists
     primarily to aid system developers when debugging the
     device-independent portion of the server.	The debugging can
     be accomplished without requiring a second physical display.

     Exposures on (and resizings of) the window are ignored, and
     so corrupt the "screen".

X DEFAULTS
     Accepts the following defaults (for the program "X", not
     "Xnest"):

     BorderWidth
	     Set the border width of the window.

     Border  Set the border color.

     CellExponent
	     If not set or set to zero, a monochrome psuedo-
	     display is created.  Otherwise, if a value of N is
	     provided, specifies the maximum number color cells
	     to be 2^N.  The number actually provided will be a
	     power of two, but may be less than 2^N if allocation
	     fails.

ENVIRONMENT
     Uses the environment variable ``DISPLAY'' to specify which
     display to use.
