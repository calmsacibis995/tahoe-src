NAME
     Xvs100 - X window system VS100 implementation notes

DESCRIPTION
     The VS100 implementation of X was the first, and is com-
     plete.  Many of the X output operations are in fact modeled
     on the interface provided by the VS100 firmware.  The VS100
     is a monochrome display, 864 bits high and 1088 bits wide.
     The firmware we are currently using is version #235.

     Cursors can be any size up to 64x64.  Tiles can only be
     16x16 in size.  Brushes can be any size, but the current
     firmware draws wide lines about an order of magnitude slower
     than 1x1 lines.  Off-screen storage is limited to that pro-
     vided in the VS100 itself; no attempt is made to use DMA
     access to VAX memory for fonts and such or to dynamically
     shuffle data back and forth.

     The keyboard is controlled by the VS100 firmware.	Unfor-
     tunately, with the current firmware, the keyboard only gives
     up transitions for the Control, Shift, Lock, and Meta keys,
     so chord applications won't work.

     At system boot, for some reason the first three attempts to
     down load the firmware fail.  Thus, a VS100 won't become
     active until about 45 seconds after other terminal lines
     activate.	Power-cycling a VS100 will cause the X server to
     restart.  The down problem doesn't occur in this case, but
     typically a 3 minute TCP CLOSE_WAIT will occur.
