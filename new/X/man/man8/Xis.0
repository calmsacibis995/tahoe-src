NAME
     Xis - X window system Integrated Solutions Optimum V WorkS-
     tation implementation notes

DESCRIPTION
     The Integrated Solutions X server cannot be started by
     init(8); it must be started as a command from a normal shell
     window or desktop icon. The Integrated Solutions X server
     should be started by xinit(1), using the following command

	  xinit -- Xis 0

     The initial Integrated Solutions drivers use the _l_i_b_g_i_p
     library to address the device, and runs on monochrome and
     color displays.  The drivers work with the 3.06 release or
     greater.

FILES
     /dev/X*   UNIX domain socket

BUGS
     The server can address only one display; this is a restric-
     tion of the X system itself and is not likely to change
     soon.

     The drivers at present have some restrictions, most of which
     should be removed in future versions:

     o+	  Dashed lines are drawn as solid.

     o+	  Filling a polygon is not implemented.

     o+	  Up events are not available for any keys on the key-
	  board.

     o+	  SHIFT/SHIFT_LOCK/CTRL/META keys are implemented using
	  the PF[1-4] on the keypad, respectively.  Pressing one
	  of these keys once sends a key-down and the second
	  press sends a key-up transition.  Pressing any other
	  keys on the keyboard effectively sends key-up for any
	  keys that are logically down.

     o+	  Time stamps on mouse input are not implemented.
