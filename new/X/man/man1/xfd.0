NAME
     xfd - X window system font displayer

SYNOPSIS
     xfd [ =_g_e_o_m_e_t_r_y ] [ _h_o_s_t:_n_u_m_b_e_r ] [ options ] fontname

DESCRIPTION
     _X_f_d creates a window which displays all characters in the
     named font.  The characters are displayed in increasing
     ASCII order, 8 to a line, from the first to the last charac-
     ter defined in the font.

     The font name is interpreted by the X server.  On a VAX, if
     the name does not begin with ``/'', the X server adds the
     suffix ``.onx'' to it and looks up the font file in the
     directory /_u_s_r/_n_e_w/_l_i_b/_X/_f_o_n_t/.  If the name does begin with
     ``/'', the X server treats it as an absolute pathname of a
     file containing a font.

     If no font name is given on the command line, _x_f_d displays
     the font ``vtsingle''.

     The window stays around until the xfd process is killed  or
     a mouse button is pressed on the window.

OPTIONS
     _h_o_s_t:_d_i_s_p_l_a_y
	     Normally, _x_f_d gets the host and display number to
	     use from the environment variable ``DISPLAY''.  One
	     can, however specify them explicitly.  The _h_o_s_t
	     specifies which machine to create the window on, and
	     the _d_i_s_p_l_a_y argument specifies the display number.
	     For example, ``orpheus:1'' creates a shell window on
	     display one on the machine orpheus.

     -bw _b_o_r_d_e_r_w_i_d_t_h
	     Allows you to specify the width of the window border
	     in pixels.

     -rv     The screen will be displayed with black characters
	     on a white background, rather than the default white
	     on black.

     -fg _c_o_l_o_r
	     On color displays, determines the color of the text.

     -bg _c_o_l_o_r
	     On color displays, determines the color of the back-
	     ground.

     -bd _c_o_l_o_r
	     On color displays, determines the color of the

     =_g_e_o_m_e_t_r_y
