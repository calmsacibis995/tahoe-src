NAME
     xfax - display a FAX file in an X window

SYNOPSIS
     xfax [ options ] [ =_g_e_o_m_e_t_r_y ] [ _h_o_s_t:_n_u_m_b_e_r ] file

DESCRIPTION
     _X_f_a_x displays a Dacom 450/500 Facsimile file (see NIC RFC
     803) in an X window.  By default, the host and display
     number are extracted from the environment variable
     ``DISPLAY'', but one can specify a different host in the
     command line.  The window is created in the usual way using
     a geometry specification or using a mouse button.	Clicking
     left creates a full screen window.  With the center button,
     depress the button to define one corner of the window, move
     the cursor to where the opposite corner of the window should
     be and release the button.

     Decoding the file usually takes no more than a minute, and
     then the file is displayed.  You can move around in the file
     by pressing the center button in one spot, moving somewhere,
     and releasing the button.	The spot you pointed at first
     will move to the spot you pointed at last.

OPTIONS
     On color displays, colors can be specified in the command
     line:

	  -fg=_c_o_l_o_r	 foreground
	  -bg=_c_o_l_o_r	 background
	  -bd=_c_o_l_o_r	 border
