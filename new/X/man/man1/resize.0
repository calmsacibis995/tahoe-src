NAME
     resize - reset TERMCAP with current size of a window

SYNOPSIS
     resize [-u] [-s [row col]]

DESCRIPTION
     _R_e_s_i_z_e prints on its standard output the TERM and TERMCAP
     commands for the C-shell of the current size of a window.
     It is never executed directly, but should be aliased simi-
     larly to _t_s_e_t(1) to cause the C-shell to execute the com-
     mands.

     Normally, VT102 escape sequences are used.  With the -s
     option, Sun tty escape sequences are used, which has the
     advantage that a new row and column size may be specified
     and the window will resize appropriately.

     For example, the following alias when executed as a command
     will reset the environment of the current shell:

	  alias xs  'set noglob; eval `resize`'
	  alias xrs 'set noglob; eval `resize -s \!\*`'

     The -u option will cause the commands to be formed appropri-
     ately for sh (the Bourne shell) rather than csh.

FILES
     /etc/termcap   for the base termcap entry to modify.
     ~/.cshrc  user's alias for the command.

BUGS
     ``-u'' must appear to the left of ``-s'' if both are speci-
     fied.

     There should be some global notion of display size; termcap
     and terminfo need to be rethought in the context of window
     systems.  (Fixed in 4.3BSD, and Ultrix-32 1.2)
