NAME
     pikapix - recolor an X window snapshot

SYNOPSIS
     pikapix [ -s ] [ host:number ]

DESCRIPTION
     _P_i_k_a_p_i_x takes a snapshot of an existing window, and then
     lets you change colors in the snapshot.  This can be a con-
     venient way to choose sets of colors for applications.

     When started, _p_i_k_a_p_i_x grabs the mouse, and waits for you to
     select the window you want to recolor.  Clicking the right
     button on a window selects the entire top-level window.
     Clicking the middle button on a window selects the first
     level subwindow under the mouse, or the top-level window if
     there is no subwindow.  Clicking the left button on a top-
     level window selects the lowest subwindow under the mouse,
     or the top-level window if there is no subwindow.	After a
     few moments, a snapshot of the window will appear in the
     same place as the original window.  Move the snapshot with
     your window manager if you want to compare the snapshot with
     the original window.

     As you move the cursor around in the snapshot, it will
     change color to reflect whatever pixel it is pointing at.

     If you click the middle mouse button, you will get a popup
     text window.  The prompt indicates the current color value
     in hexadecimal notation as described in _X(_1).  To change the
     color, simply type in a color name (or a color value in hex-
     adecimal notation), followed by carriage return.  Rubout and
     control-U can be used for editing.  To abort, simply click
     any mouse button in the popup, or type control-C or
     control-D.

     If you click the left mouse button, you will restore the
     color to its value in the original snapshot.

     If you click the right mouse button, you will get a popup
     mix window.  At the top are three squares with the red,
     green, and blue primaries, and at the bottom is the combined
     color and its hexadecimal notation.  Clicking the left but-
     ton in a primary decrements its value, and clicking the
     right button increments its value.  If you press the middle
     button in a primary and then move around, the vertical posi-
     tion of the mouse controls the value, with zero intensity at
     the top of the window, and full intensity at the bottom of
     the window; releasing the mouse button sets the final value.
     Clicking the right button in the combined color will exit
     the popup and change to the new color.  Clicking the middle
     button in the combined color will restore the values to

     their current state in the snapshot.  Clicking the left but-
     ton in the combined color will restore the values to their
     state in the original snapshot.

     Typing control-C or control-D in the snapshot will terminate
     the program.

     By default, once the snapshot is created, it no longer
     depends on the existence of the original window, and the
     color in the snapshot will dynamically track the color in
     the popup mix window.  However, a potentially large number
     of color map entries may be required for this mode.  If not
     enough entries are available, the ``-s'' can be used.  When
     run with the ``-s'' option, the snapshot continues to depend
     on colors from the original window, new colors are shared
     when possible, and the snapshot is completely repainted
     after every change in color.

ENVIRONMENT
     DISPLAY   This program gets the display to use by default
     from this variable.

BUGS
     Redisplay is very slow on all but small windows.
