XREFRESH(1)	    UNIX Programmer's Manual	      XREFRESH(1)



NAME
     xrefresh - refresh all windows on the screen.

SYNOPSIS
     xrefresh [ _h_o_s_t:_d_i_s_p_l_a_y ]

DESCRIPTION
     _X_r_e_f_r_e_s_h is a trivial X program to cause your screen to be
     completely repainted.  _X_r_e_f_r_e_s_h just throws a window over
     the whole screen and unmaps it, causing refresh events to be
     sent to all applications.

ARGUMENT SUMMARY
     _h_o_s_t:_d_i_s_p_l_a_y This	argument  allow  you  to  specify the
     host and display number on which to display the window dump.
     For example ``xrefresh orpheus:1'' would specify that the
     dump will appear on display `1' on the machine `orpheus'.
     By default, _x_r_e_f_r_e_s_h uses the host and display number stored
     in the environment variable DISPLAY, and therefore this
     argument is not normally specified.

ENVIRONMENT
     DISPLAY - To get default host and display number.
