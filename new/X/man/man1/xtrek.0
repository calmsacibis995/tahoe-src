     xtrek - Multiplayer startrek game for X window system

SYNOPSIS
     xfax [ options ] [ _h_o_s_t:_n_u_m_b_e_r ] file

DESCRIPTION
     _X_t_r_e_k

     is an addictive multiplayer star trek game.  The program
     "/usr/games/daemon" must already be running on the machine
     which is supporting the game.  The argument to _x_t_r_e_k speci-
     fies which display to display the game on.

     See the _x_t_r_e_k document for a detailed explanation of how to
     run the game.

BUGS
     Requires System V shared memory.  All parts of the game must
     run on a single machine, though display can be anywhere.
