NAME
     xterm - X window system terminal emulator

SYNOPSIS
     xterm [ option ] ...

DESCRIPTION
     _X_t_e_r_m is the _X window system terminal emulator.  It attempts
     to emulate a DEC VT102 terminal to provide a standard termi-
     nal type for programs not aware of the window system
     directly.	Under 4.3BSD, Ultrix 1.2 and other systems with
     the capability, _x_t_e_r_m supports the terminal resizing facili-
     ties built into the system.

     In addition, _x_t_e_r_m emulates the Tektronix 4015 in a separate
     window.  To maintain the correct aspect ratio
     (height/width), Tektronix graphics will be restricted to the
     largest box with a 4015's aspect ratio that will fit in the
     window.  This box is located in the upper left area of the
     window.

     Both windows may be displayed at the same time, though only
     one window and mode is active at a time.  Input will be
     displayed in the active window even if the mouse is in the
     other window.  Switching between the active modes is possi-
     ble under manual (menu) and program (escape sequence) con-
     trol.

     _X_t_e_r_m understands the following options.  If the option
     begins with a `+' instead of a `-', the option is restored
     to its default value.  These options override those set in
     the ``.Xdefaults'' file (see the X DEFAULTS section).

     -132	 Normally, the VT102 DECCOLM escape sequence that
		 switches between 80 and 132 column mode is
		 ignored.  This option causes the DECCOLM escape
		 sequence to be recognized, and the _x_t_e_r_m window
		 will resize appropriately.

     -C          When _x_t_e_r_m is run on a Sun, this option causes
		 messages normally destined for the console dev-
		 ice, to be displayed in the _x_t_e_r_m window.

     -L          indicates that _x_t_e_r_m is being called by _i_n_i_t(8),
		 and should presume that its file descriptors are
		 already open on a slave pseudo-tty, and that
		 _g_e_t_t_y(8) should be run rather than the user's
		 shell.  This option should only be used by
		 _i_n_i_t(8)

     -ar	 This option turns on the auto-raise mode of
		 _x_t_e_r_m, which automatically raises the window

		 when the mouse cursor enters the window.

     -b _b_o_r_d_e_r	 _X_t_e_r_m maintains an inner border (distance
		 between characters and the window's border) of
		 one pixel.  The -b option allows you to set the
		 size of this border to _b_o_r_d_e_r.

     -bd _c_o_l_o_r	 On color displays, determines the color of the
		 (highlighted) border.

     -bg _c_o_l_o_r	 On color displays, determines the color of the
		 background.

     -bi	 This option forces the icon to be a static bit-
		 map rather than the default miniature window.

     -bw _b_o_r_d_e_r_w_i_d_t_h
		 Allows you to specify the width of the window
		 border in pixels.

     -cr _c_o_l_o_r	 On color displays, determines the (highlighted)
		 color of the text cursor; default is the text
		 (foreground) color.

     -cu	 Several programs that use the _c_u_r_s_e_s(3x) cursor
		 motion package have some difficulties with
		 VT102-compatible terminals.  The bug fixed with
		 this option occurs with _m_o_r_e(1) on a file con-
		 taining a line that is exactly the width of the
		 window and which is followed by line beginning
		 with a tab.  Normally, the leading tabs disap-
		 pear, but this option causes them to be
		 displayed correctly.

     -dw	 When the _x_t_e_r_m icon is deiconified, this option
		 warps the mouse to the center of the window.

     -e _c_o_m_m_a_n_d _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s
		 The specified _c_o_m_m_a_n_d will be executed in the
		 window, rather than starting a shell.	The com-
		 mand and the optional arguments must appear last
		 on the _x_t_e_r_m command line.

     -fb _f_o_n_t	 The specified _f_o_n_t will be used instead of the
		 default bold font (which is ``vtbold'').  This
		 font must be the same height and width as the
		 normal font.  If only one of the normal or bold
		 fonts is specified, it will be used as the nor-
		 mal font and the bold font will be produced by
		 overstriking this font.

     -fg _c_o_l_o_r	 On color displays, determines the color of the

		 text (foreground).

     -fi _f_o_n_t	 Specifies the default font to be used for the
		 miniature icon windows.  The usual value for the
		 icon font is ``nil2''.

     -fn _f_o_n_t	 The specified _f_o_n_t will be used instead of the
		 default font (which is ``vtsingle'').	Any fixed
		 width font may be used.

     -ft _f_o_n_t	 The specified _f_o_n_t will be used in the title bar
		 instead of the default font (which is ``vtsin-
		 gle'').

     -i          This option causes _x_t_e_r_m to startup displaying
		 the icon rather than the normal window.

     -ib _f_i_l_e	 The _f_i_l_e, which is assumed to be in _b_i_t_m_a_p(1)
		 format, is read and the resulting bitmap is used
		 in the icon when in VT102 mode.  If only one
		 bitmap file is specified, it is used for both
		 modes.  If both the bitmap file names are null,
		 no bitmap is used.

     -it _f_i_l_e	 The _f_i_l_e, which is assumed to be in _b_i_t_m_a_p(1)
		 format, is read and the resulting bitmap is used
		 in the icon when in Tektronix mode.  If only one
		 bitmap file is specified, it is used for both
		 modes.  If both the bitmap file names are null,
		 no bitmap is used.

     -j          _X_t_e_r_m will `jump scroll'; when _x_t_e_r_m falls
		 behind scrolling the screen, it will move multi-
		 ple lines up at once.	The VT100 escape
		 sequences for smooth scroll can be used to
		 enable/disable this feature from a program, or
		 the `Mode Menu' can be used to set it interac-
		 tively.

     -l          Logging is turned on; all input from the pseudo
		 tty is appended to the logfile.

     -lf _f_i_l_e	 This _f_i_l_e specifies the file in which the log is
		 written to, rather than the default
		 ``XtermLog._X_X_X_X_X'' where _X_X_X_X_X is the process id
		 of _x_t_e_r_m (the file is created in the directory
		 _x_t_e_r_m is started in, or the home directory for a
		 login _x_t_e_r_m).	If _f_i_l_e begins with a ``|'' then
		 the rest of the string is assumed to be a com-
		 mand to be executed by the shell, and a pipe is
		 opened to the process.

     -ls	 This option causes the shell run under _x_t_e_r_m to
		 be a login shell (the user's .login file is read
		 and the initial directory will be the home
		 directory).

     -mb	 This option turns on the right margin bell.

     -ms _c_o_l_o_r	 On color displays, determines the color of the
		 mouse cursor; default is the text cursor color.

     -n _w_i_n_d_o_w_n_a_m_e
		 Allows you to set the name of the window for use
		 by a window manager.  This name is displayed in
		 the title bar, also.

     -nb _n_u_m_b_e_r  This _n_u_m_b_e_r is used as the right margin distance
		 in which the margin bell will ring (the default
		 is 10).

     -po _n_u_m_b_e_r  Normally, in page scroll mode, a ``page'' is
		 defined to be the number of lines in the scrol-
		 ling region minus the page overlap, which is one
		 by default.  _N_u_m_b_e_r specifies a new page over-
		 lap.

     -ps	 Page scroll mode is initially turned on.  After
		 a ``page'' of lines is displayed, _x_t_e_r_m will
		 stop displaying any more lines and the text cur-
		 sor will disappear.  Typing a carriage return
		 will allow one more line to be scrolled (the
		 return is discarded).	Pressing the space bar
		 (or any other printable character) allows
		 another page to be scrolled (the character is
		 discarded).  Typing a control character allows
		 another page to be scrolled, but the control
		 character is sent (e.g., the interrupt charac-
		 ter).

     -r          The screen will be displayed with white charac-
		 ters on a black background, rather than the
		 default black on white.  This becomes the normal
		 video mode, which is reversed by turning on the
		 reverse video mode.

     -rv	 Same as -r.

     -rw	 This options turns on reverse-wraparound mode,
		 that allows the cursor to wraparound from the
		 leftmost column to the rightmost column of the
		 previous line.  This is very useful in the shell
		 to allow erasure backwards across the previous
		 line.

     -s          When this option is specified, xterm no longer
		 scrolls synchronously with the display.  _X_t_e_r_m
		 no longer attempts to keep the screen completely
		 up to date while scrolling, but can then run
		 faster when network latencies are very high.
		 This is typically useful when using _x_t_e_r_m across
		 a very large internet or many hops.

     -sb	 This option causes the scrollbar to be displayed
		 during startup, with the saving of lines
		 scrolled off the top of the window being turned
		 on.

     -si	 When using the scrollbar to review previous
		 lines of text, the window is normally reposi-
		 tioned automatically at the bottom of the scroll
		 region when input has arrived.  This option dis-
		 ables repositioning on input.

     -sk	 When using the scrollbar to review pass lines of
		 text, this option causes the window to be repo-
		 sitioned automatically in the normal postion at
		 the bottom of the scroll region when a key is
		 pressed.

     -sl _n_u_m_b_e_r  The _n_u_m_b_e_r specifies the maximum number of lines
		 to save that are scrolled off the top of the
		 window.  The default is 64 lines.

     -sn	 By default, the status line is in revere-video
		 (relative to the rest of the window).	This
		 option causes the status line to be in normal
		 video (the status line is still enclosed in a
		 box).

     -st	 This option causes the status line to be
		 displayed on startup.

     -t          This option causes the initial _x_t_e_r_m window to
		 be the Tektronix window, rather than the normal
		 VT102 window.

     -tb	 This option disables the title bar from being
		 displayed on startup.

     -ti	 Normally in the icon, the window name is to the
		 right of the bitmap.  This option causes the
		 text to be under the icon.

     -vb	 This option turns on the visual bell mode, which
		 flashes the window on receipt of a CTRL-G.

     -w          Same as -bw.

     =_g_e_o_m_e_t_r_y	 _X_t_e_r_m will take a normal X geometry specifica-
		 tion for the VT102 window.  This takes the form
		 of ``=_w_i_d_t_hx_h_e_i_g_h_t+_x_o_f_f+_y_o_f_f''.  See _X(1) for
		 details of this specification.

     %_g_e_o_m_e_t_r_y	 This geometry specification applies to the Tek-
		 tronix window.

     #_g_e_o_m_e_t_r_y	 This geometry specification applies to the icon
		 position (the width and height information are
		 optional and otherwise ignored).

     _h_o_s_t:_d_i_s_p_l_a_y
		 Normally, _x_t_e_r_m gets the host and display number
		 to use from the environment variable
		 ``DISPLAY''.  One can, however specify them
		 explicitly.  The _h_o_s_t specifies which machine to
		 create the window on, and the _d_i_s_p_l_a_y argument
		 specifies the display number.	For example,
		 ``orpheus:1'' creates a shell window on display
		 one on the machine orpheus.

X DEFAULTS
     _X_t_e_r_m allows you to preset defaults in a customization file
     in your home directory, called .Xdefaults.  The format of
     the file is ``programname.keyword:string''.  See _X(1) for
     more details.  _X_t_e_r_m obeys the convention for `MakeWindow'
     defaults.	Keywords recognized by _x_t_e_r_m are listed below.

		    when _x_t_e_r_m windows are in their iconified
		    state and the icon is a miniature window.
		    Keyboard input is always disabled when static
		    bitmap icons are used.

EMULATIONS
     The VT102 emulation is fairly complete, but does not support
     the blinking character attribute nor the double-wide and
     double-size character sets.  _T_e_r_m_c_a_p(5) entries that work
     with _x_t_e_r_m include ``xterms'', ``xterm'', ``vt102'',
     ``vt100'' and ``ansi'', and _x_t_e_r_m automatically searches the

     termcap file in this order for these entries and then sets
     the ``TERM'' and the ``TERMCAP'' environment variables.

     Many of the special _x_t_e_r_m features (like the scrollbar and
     logging) may be modified under program control through a set
     of escape sequences different from the standard VT102 escape
     sequences.  Also, many of the Sun tty escape sequences for
     resizing and moving the window are also understood.  (See
     the ``_X_t_e_r_m _C_o_n_t_r_o_l _S_e_q_u_e_n_c_e_s'' document.)

     The Tektronix 4015 emulation is also fairly good.	Four dif-
     ferent font sizes and five different lines types are sup-
     ported.  The Tektronix text and graphics commands are
     recorded internally by _x_t_e_r_m and may be written to a file by
     sending the COPY escape sequence (or through the Tektronix
     menu; see below).	The name of the file will be
     ``COPY_y_y-_M_M-_d_d._h_h:_m_m:_s_s'', where _y_y, _M_M, _d_d, _h_h, _m_m and _s_s
     are the year, month, day, hour, minute and second when the
     COPY was performed (the file is created in the directory
     _x_t_e_r_m is started in, or the home directory for a login
     _x_t_e_r_m).

MOUSE USAGE
     When using the mouse to create the VT102 window, a cursor
     and a rubber banding box will outline where the window will
     be created on the display.  If the left button is pressed, a
     HEIGHTxWIDTH (default 24x80) size window will be created at
     the position where the button is released.  If the right
     button is pressed, a window the height of the display and
     WIDTH (default 80) characters wide will be created.  If the
     center button is pressed and held down, the upper left hand
     corner of the window is defined at this position.	An out-
     line of the minimum size window is shown, and a popup window
     in the upper left hand corner of the display will show the
     size in characters of the window.	Moving the mouse (while
     still holding the button down) will enlarge the window and
     the sizes in the pop up window will update accordingly.
     Releasing the button will define the lower right hand corner
     of the window.

     Once the VT102 window is created, _x_t_e_r_m allows you to save
     text and restore it within the same or other windows.  The
     button functions are enabled when holding down the ``shift''
     key.  The left hand button takes the text from the cursor
     (at button release) through the end of line (including the
     new line), saves it in the global cut buffer, and immedi-
     ately `retypes' the line, inserting it as keyboard input.
     This provides a history mechanism.  The selected text is
     highlighted while the button is pressed.  Moving off the
     initial line will cancel the selection.  If there is no text
     beyond the initial cursor point, _x_t_e_r_m will sound the bell,
     indicating an error.

     The shifted center button is used to save text into the cut
     buffer.  Move the cursor to beginning of the text, and then
     hold the button down while moving the cursor to the end of
     the region and releasing the button.  The selected text is
     highlighted and is saved in the global cut buffer when the
     button is released.

     The shifted right hand button `types' (pastes) the text from
     the cut buffer, inserting it as keyboard input.  By cutting
     and pasting pieces of text without trailing new lines, you
     can take text from several places in different windows and
     form a command to the shell, for example, or take output
     from a program and insert it into your favorite editor.
     Since the cut buffer is globally shared among different
     applications, you should regard it as a `file' whose con-
     tents you know.  The terminal emulator and other text pro-
     grams should be treating it as if it were a text file, i.e.
     the text is delimited by new lines.

     The scrollbar is composed of three parts, the scroll button
     at the top, the recorder button in the middle and the scroll
     region at the bottom.  Pressing the middle button in any
     part of the scrollbar will display the scrollbar menu; see
     the MENUS section below.

     The scroll region displays the position and amount of text
     currently showing in the window (highlighted) relative to
     the amount of text actually saved.  As more text is saved
     (up to the maximum), the size of the highlighted area
     decreases.  Clicking the mouse with the left of right button
     in the scroll region will position the top of the display
     window at the mouse position.

     The recorder button shows the state of saving lines scrolled
     off the top of the window.  Tape running reel to reel indi-
     cates on, while the tape hanging indicates off.  Clicking
     the left or right button in the recorder button toggles the
     state of recording.

     The scroll button causes the window to scroll up and down
     within the saved text.  The left button moves the window
     position up (the text scrolls downward), while the right
     button moves the window position down (the text scrolls
     upward).  The amount of scrolling is modified by the
     ``shift'' and ``control'' keys.  Without either, the window
     scrolls a single line at a time.  Continuing to hold the
     button down will causes the text to continuously scroll a
     line at a time.

     The ``shift'' key causes the text to scroll a window full at
     a time (actually it is one line less than a full window).
     And the ``control'' key causes the text to be positioned at

     the extremes, top or bottom.

     When using the mouse to create the Tektronix window, a cur-
     sor and a rubber banding box will outline where the window
     will be created on the display.  If the left button is
     pressed, a default size window (750 pixels wide by 565 pixel
     high) is created at the origin.  If the right button is
     pressed, a default size window is created at the mouse posi-
     tion.  If the center button is pressed and held down, the
     upper left hand corner of the window is defined at this
     position.	An outline of the minimum size window is shown,
     and a popup window in the upper left hand corner of the
     display will appear, indicating Tektronix mode.  Moving the
     mouse (while still holding the button down) will enlarge the
     window.  Releasing the button will define the lower right
     hand corner of the window.

     Unlike the VT102 window, the Tektronix window dows not allow
     the copying of text.  It does allow Tektronix GIN mode, and
     in this mode the cursor will change from an arrow to a
     cross.  Pressing any key will send that key and the current
     coordinate of the cross cursor.  Pressing the left, middle
     or right button will return the letters `l', `m', and `r',
     respectively.  If the `shift' key is pressed when a mouse
     buton is pressed, the corresponding upper case letter is
     sent.  To distinquish a mouse button from a key, the high
     bit of the character is set (but this is bit is normally
     stripped unless the terminal mode is RAW; see _t_t_y(4) for
     details).

MENUS
     _X_t_e_r_m has five different menus, named xterm, Modes, Tek-
     tronix, Scrollbar and Windows.  Each menu pops up under the
     correct combinations of key and button presses.  Most menus
     are divided into two section, separated by a horizontal
     line.  The top portion contains various modes that can be
     altered.  A check mark appears next to a mode that is
     currently active.	Selecting one of these modes toggles its
     state.  The bottom portion of the menu are command entries;
     selecting one of these performs the indicated function.

     The xterm menu pops up when the ``control'' key and the left
     button is pressed in a window.  The menu title gives the
     version number of _x_t_e_r_m.  The modes section contains items
     that apply to both the VT102 and Tektronix windows.  Notable
     entries in the command section of the menu are the Continue,
     Suspend, Interrupt, Hangup, Terminate and Kill which sends
     the SIGCONT, SIGTSTP, SIGINT, SIGHUP, SIGTERM and SIGKILL
     signals, respectively, to the process group of the process
     running under _x_t_e_r_m (usually the shell).  The Continue func-
     tion is especially useful if the user has accidentally typed
     CTRL-Z, suspending the process.

     The Modes menu sets various modes in the VT102 emulation,
     and is popped up with the ``control'' and middle button com-
     bination in the VT102 window.  In the command section of
     this menu, the soft reset entry will reset scroll regions.
     This can be convenient when some program has left the scroll
     regions set incorrectly (often a problem when using VMS or
     TOPS-20).	The full reset entry will clear the screen, reset
     tabs to every eight columns, and reset the terminal modes
     (such as wrap and smooth scroll) to there initial states
     just after _x_t_e_r_m has finish processing the command line
     options.  The Tektronix menu sets various modes in the Tek-
     tronix emulation, and is popped up with the ``control'' and
     middle button combination in the Tektronix window.  The
     current font size is checked in the modes section of the
     menu.  The PAGE entry in the command section clears the Tek-
     tronix window.

     The Scrollbar menu is popped up when the middle button is
     pressed within the scrollbar.  This menu allows several
     modes particular to the scrollbar to be set.

     The Windows menu is not normally compiled into _x_t_e_r_m as it
     duplicates functions that properly belong to window
     managers.	It may, however, be enabled at the discretion of
     your system builder.

     If enabled, the Windows menu is a special menu that is
     popped up when the ``control'' key and right button are
     pressed.  Listed in order of bottommost to topmost are the
     visible windows on the display that are named.  The checked
     entry is the current window.  By selecting an entry, the
     corresponding window is raised to the top.  This is very
     useful when a particular window of interest is obscured by
     many other windows.

OTHER FEATURES
     _X_t_e_r_m automatically highlights the window border, text cur-
     sor and titlebar when the mouse enters the window (selected)
     and unhighlights them when the mouse leaves the window
     (unselected).  If the window is the focus window, then the
     window is highlighted no matter where the mouse is.

     The titlebar displays the name of the window in the center
     and on both sides stripes appear when the window is selected
     (highlighted).  If both windows are showing, only the active
     window's titlebar is highlighted.	If the left, middle or
     right button is pressed in the stripped section of the
     titlebar, the corresponding menu is popped up, without the
     need to hold down the ``control'' key.  Pressing the mouse
     button in the center title of the titlebar causes the window
     to automatically iconify.	Pressing a button in the icon
     deiconifies it.  In addition, if input comes in while _x_t_e_r_m

     is iconified and the icon is a static bitmap, a box is drawn
     around the icon title.

     In VT102 mode, there are escape sequences to activate and
     deactivate an alternate screen buffer, which is the same
     size as the display area of the window.  When activated, the
     current screen is saved and replace with the alternate
     screen.  Saving of lines scrolled off the top of the window
     and page scroll mode are disabled, until the normal screen
     is restored.  The _t_e_r_m_c_a_p(5) entry for _x_t_e_r_m allows the
     visual editor _v_i(1) to switch to the alternate screen for
     editing, and restore the screen on exit.

     In either VT102 or Tektronix mode, there are escape
     sequences to change the title in the title bar (which will
     also change the name of the windows and icons) and to
     specify a new log file name.

     By default, a miniature version of the VT102 or Tektronix
     window is displayed when _x_t_e_r_m is iconified.  The choice of
     which miniature to display is made when the full window(s)
     are iconified; if the Tek window is chosen in the iconify
     operation, then the icon will be a miniature Tek window and
     if the VT102 window is chosen, the icon will be a miniature
     VT102 window.  This choice is independent of the current
     mode (Tektronix/VT102).

     As an option, the miniature window may be disabled and a
     bitmap of a small VT102 window with titlebar and scrollbar
     can be displayed in the icon when in VT102 mode, and a bit-
     map of a Tektronix window with titlebar is displayed in Tek-
     tronix mode.  these bitmaps may be user-defined (see options
     above).

ENVIRONMENT
     _X_t_e_r_m sets the environment variables ``TERM'' and
     ``TERMCAP'' properly for the size window you have created.
     It also uses and sets the environment variable ``DISPLAY''
     to specify which bit map display terminal to use.	The
     environment variable ``WINDOWID'' is set to the X window id
     number of the _x_t_e_r_m window.

BUGS
     There is currently no way for a _x_t_e_r_m window not to
     highlight itself when the mouse cursor enter it while
     another window is the keyboard focus.  There needs to be a
     dialog box to allow entry of log file name and the COPY file
     name.  Many of the options are not resettable after _x_t_e_r_m
