SYNOPSIS
     xdvi [-s _s_h_r_i_n_k] [-p _p_i_x_e_l_s] [-l] [-rv] [-fg _c_o_l_o_r] [-bg

     [_h_o_s_t:_d_i_s_p_l_a_y] file

DESCRIPTION
     _X_d_v_i is a program which runs under the X window system. It
     is used to preview DVI files, such as produced by TeX.

     The -p option defines the pixels per inch for font selec-
     tion.  Default value is 300.

     The -s option defines the initial shrink factor.  Default
     value is 4.

     The -l option causes used fonts to be listed on diagnostic
     output.

MOUSE
     Clicking the right button will display the next page.
     Clicking the left button will display the previous page.
     Clicking the right button with the Shift key held down will
     display the next window full to the right.  Clicking the
     left button with the Shift key held down will display the
     previous window full to the left.	Clicking the middle but-
     ton will display the next window full down.  Clicking the
     middle button with the Shift key held down will display the
     next window full up.

KEYBOARD
     You can exit the program by typing `q', control-C, or
     control-D.  You can move to the next page with `n', `f', or
     SPACE.  You can move the the previous page with `p', `b', or
     control-H.  You can move up a window-full with `u', down
     with `d', left with `l', and right with `r'.  You can change
     the shrink factor by typing in the number (one or more
     digits), followed by `s'.	If you type `s' without a number,
     the smallest factor that makes the entire page fit in the
     window will be used.  You can force redisplay with control-
     L.  You can move a relative number of pages by typing an
     optional `-', a number (one or more digits) and then car-
     riage return or line feed.  You can move to a specific page
     by typing a number (one or more digits) and then `g'.  You
     can move to the last page by typing `g' without a number.
