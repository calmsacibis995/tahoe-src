NAME
     xwd - X Window System, window image dumper.

SYNOPSIS
     xwd [ -debug ] [ -help ] [ -nobdrs ] [ -out _f_i_l_e ] [ -xy ] [
     _h_o_s_t:_d_i_s_p_l_a_y ]

DESCRIPTION
     _X_w_d is an X Window System (protocol version 10) window image
     dumping utility.  _X_w_d allows X users to store window images
     in a specially formated window dump file.	This file can
     then be read by various other X utilities for redisplay,
     printing, editing, formatting, archiving, image processing
     etc..  The target window is selected by clicking the mouse
     in the desired window.  The keyboard bell is rung once at
     the beginning of the dump and twice when the dump is com-
     pleted.  The window dump file format is currently under
     development; no guarantee of upward compatibility is made:
     the dump file format will be completely different under V11.

ARGUMENT SUMMARY
     -help   Print out the `Usage:' command syntax summary.

     -nobdrs This argument specifies that the window dump  should
	     not  include  the pixels that compose the X window
	     border.  This is useful in situations where you may
	     wish to include the  window  contents in a document
	     as an illustration.

     -out _f_i_l_e
	     This argument allows the user to explicitly specify
	     the output file on the command line.  The default is
	     to output to standard out.

     -xy     This option applies to color displays only. It
	     selects `XY' format dumping instead of the default
	     `Z' format. Monochrome displays are always dumped in
	     `XY' format.

     _h_o_s_t:_d_i_s_p_l_a_y
	     This  argument  allow  you  to  specify the host and
	     display number on which to find the target window.
	     For example `xwd orpheus:1' would specify that the
	     target window is on display `1' on the machine
	     `orpheus'.  By default, _x_w_d uses the host and
	     display number stored in the environment variable
	     DISPLAY, and therefore this argument is not normally
	     specified.

ENVIRONMENT
     DISPLAY To get default host and display number.
