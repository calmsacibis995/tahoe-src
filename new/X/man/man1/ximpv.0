NAME
     ximpv - Imprint (Impress) Previewer for the X Window System

SYNOPSIS
     ximpv [=_g_e_o_m_e_t_r_y] [-p#] [-rv] [-fg _c_o_l_o_r] [-bg _c_o_l_o_r] [-bd
     _c_o_l_o_r] [-ms _c_o_l_o_r] [_h_o_s_t:_d_i_s_p_l_a_y] file

DESCRIPTION
     _X_i_m_p_v is a program which runs under the X window system. It
     is used to preview images which is destined for an Imagen
     laser printer.

     The -_p# option, if used, will set the number of pages you
     can back up to #. Default is five pages. Zero (or no number)
     runs faster as the pages do not have to be transferred to
     disk.

     If the _f_i_l_e given to ximpv is correct a square will appear
     on the screen indicating text is about to appear.	If no
     _f_i_l_e is given stdin must be from a pipe or an error message
     is printed and the program aborted.

     The pages of the file are displayed in the order.	Only
     about 2/3 of a page can be displayed at once (this is
     because of aspect ratio differences).

ARGUMENTS
     -bd _c_o_l_o_r
	     Specify the border color.

     -ms _c_o_l_o_r
	     Specify the mouse color.

     -fg _c_o_l_o_r
	     Specify the foreground color.

     -bg _c_o_l_o_r
	     Specify the background color.

     -bw _w_i_d_t_h
	     Specify the width of the border.

     -rv     Cause _x_i_m_p_v to produce all output in black-on-white
	     instead of white-on-black.

     =_g_e_o_m_e_t_r_y
	     The previewer window is created with the specified
	     size specified by the geometry specification.  See
	     _X(_1) for details of this specification.
