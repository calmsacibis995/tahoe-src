NAME
     biff - be notified if mail arrives and who it is from

SYNOPSIS
     biff [ yn ]

DESCRIPTION
     _B_i_f_f informs the system whether you want to be notified when
     mail arrives during the current terminal session.	The com-
     mand

	  biff y

     enables notification; the command

	  biff n

     disables it.  When mail notification is enabled, the header
     and first few lines of the message will be printed on your
     screen whenever mail arrives.  A ``biff y'' command is often
     included in the file ._l_o_g_i_n or ._p_r_o_f_i_l_e to be executed at
     each login.

     _B_i_f_f operates asynchronously.  For synchronous notification
     use the MAIL variable of _s_h(1) or the _m_a_i_l variable of
     _c_s_h(1).

X WINDOW SYSTEM
     If you are logged in under the X window system, a popup win-
     dow is used instead of a message to your login window.  To
     delete the window, click any mouse button with the mouse in
     the window.  Properties of the window can be controlled with
     options for _b_i_f_f in your ._X_d_e_f_a_u_l_t_s file.	The following
     options are recognized:

     Background

     Border  To determine the border color.

     BorderWidth
	     To determine the border width.  Default is 2.

     Foreground
	     To determine the foreground color.

     InternalBorder
	     To determine the padding around the text.	Default
	     is 2.
