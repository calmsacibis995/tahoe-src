NAME
     xinit - X window system initializer

SYNOPSIS
     xinit [[client] options] [-- [server] [display] options]

DESCRIPTION
     _X_i_n_i_t is intended to be used when the X window system server
     is not run automatically from _i_n_i_t(_8), and the window system
     must be started from a shell running on the display.  This
     might be true, for example, if a normal login is run in a
     glass-tty emulator on a workstation console, so that dif-
     ferent window systems can easily be run on the display at
     different times.

     _X_i_n_i_t starts up the server and a single client application,
     which is typically _x_t_e_r_m(_1).  When the client eventually
     terminates, _x_i_n_i_t automatically kills off the server and
     then itself terminates.

     By default, _x_i_n_i_t expects the server to exist in an execut-
     able named ``X'' in the search path, and for _x_t_e_r_m(_1) to
     also exist in the search path. It starts up the X server on
     display 0, and then starts up
	  xterm =+1+1 -n login unix:0

     A different client and/or server can be specified in the
     command line, and command line options can be passed to both
     the server and the client.  The client and its options come
     first in the command line.  The server and its options must
     be preceded by ``--''.  If the first argument to xinit
     begins with `/' or a letter, it is taken to be the client
     program to use instead of xterm, and none of the default
     xterm options are used.  Otherwise, the first and subsequent
     arguments are simply appended as further options to the
     default _x_t_e_r_m command line.

     Following the ``--'' argument, if the next argument begins
     with `/' or a letter, it is taken to be the server program
     to use instead of ``X''.  If the next argument begins with a
     digit, it is taken to be the display number; otherwise
     display 0 is assumed.  The remaining arguments are added as
     options to the server command line.

     Examples:

     xinit =80x65+10+10 -fn 8x13 -j -fg white -bg navy
     xinit -e widgets -- Xsun -l -c
     xinit rsh fasthost cpupig workstation:1 -- 1 -a 2 -t 5
