NAME
     xclock - X Window System, analog / digital clock

SYNOPSIS
     xclock [ option ] ...

DESCRIPTION
     _X_c_l_o_c_k is the _X window system clock.  _X_c_l_o_c_k Continuously
     displays  the  current  time of day.  The user is given a
     choice of either an analog or a digital display (of  course
     there  is nothing	precluding  the  user  from  having more
     than one clock).  It creates a window and displays the time
     in the chosen format.

ARGUMENTS
     -analog   Use analog display mode.  Draw a conventional 12
	       hour clock face with ``ticks'' for each minute and
	       stroke marks on each hour.  The default is digital
	       mode.

     -bg _c_o_l_o_r Determines the color of the background.	The
	       default color is ``white''.  On monochrome
	       displays this is ignored.

     -bd _c_o_l_o_r Determines the color of the border.  The defaults
	       color is ``black''.  On monochrome displays this
	       is ignored.

     -bw _p_i_x_e_l_s
	       Specify the width in pixels of the border around
	       the _x_c_l_o_c_k window.

     -digital  Use  digital  display  mode  (default).	 Display
	       the date and time in digital format.

     -fg _c_o_l_o_r Determines the color of the text in digital mode
	       and the tick marks in analog mode.  The default
	       color is ``black''.  On monochrome displays this
	       is ignored.

     -hd _c_o_l_o_r Determines the color of the hands of the clock.
	       This is ignored on monchrome displays.

     -fn _f_o_n_t  The specified _f_o_n_t will be used as the output font
	       in digital mode.  Any fixed width font may be
	       used, the default is ``6x10''.

     -help     Display a brief summary of _x_c_l_o_c_k'_s calling syntax
	       and options.

     -hl _c_o_l_o_r Determines the color of the hands in analog mode.
	       The defaults is to make them the same as the

	       foreground color.  On monochrome displays this is
	       ignored.

     -padding _p_i_x_e_l_s
	       Specify the width in pixels of the padding ``white
	       space'' between the window border and anything
	       _x_c_l_o_c_k displays.  The default padding is 10 in
	       digital mode and 8 in analog mode.

     -rv       Reverses the default color values (i.e., black
	       becomes white and white becomes black).

     -update _s_e_c_o_n_d_s
	       Specify the frequency in seconds with which _x_c_l_o_c_k
	       updates its display.  If the _x_c_l_o_c_k window is
	       obscured and then exposed, _x_c_l_o_c_k will override
	       this setting  and  redisplay  immediately.   The
	       default update  frequency  is  60  seconds.   The
	       specification  of an update frequency greater than
	       30 seconds disables the display of  the	second
	       hand in analog mode.

     -chime    Cause the clock to ``chime'' once on the half hour
	       and twice on the hour.

     =_g_e_o_m_e_t_r_y
	     The clock window is created with the specified size
	     according to the geometry specification.  See _X(_1)
	     for details.  In digital mode if you do not specify
	     either height and width they are determined  by  the
	     font in use.  In analog mode if you do not specify
	     either width or height they default to 164.  The
	     default  offset  for any unspecified offset is -0.
	     All values are in pixels.

     _h_o_s_t:_d_i_s_p_l_a_y
	       Normally, _x_c_l_o_c_k gets  the host and display number
	       to use from the environment variable ``DISPLAY''.
	       One can, however specify them explicitly.  The
	       _h_o_s_t specifies which machine to create the _x_c_l_o_c_k
	       window on, and the _d_i_s_p_l_a_y argument specifies the
	       display number.	For example, ``mit-frobozz:1''
	       creates an _x_c_l_o_c_k on display one on the machine
	       mit-frobozz.  If the host is omitted the local
	       host  is  assumed.   If	the  display  is omitted,
	       display 0 is assumed, the ``:'' is necessary in
	       either case.

BUGS

     size manually  in digital	mode  the  string should be cen-
     tered automatically, currently you have to fiddle with the
