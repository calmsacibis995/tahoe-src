NAME
     xset - X window system user setup program

SYNOPSIS
     xset option [ option ] [ _f_h_o_s_t:_d_i_s_p_l_a_y ]

DESCRIPTION
     This program is used to set various user preference options
     of the display.  The c option controls key click, the l
     option controls the lock key, the r option controls the auto
     repeat, the b option controls bell volume, the m option con-
     trols the mouse parameters, the p option controls pixel
     color values, and the s and v options let you set the screen
     saver parameters.	Any of these can be preceded with a - to
     disable the feature, or followed by on or off if you prefer.
     The keyclick option can also be followed by an optional
     digit between 1 and 8 to indicate volume.	For example:
     ``xset c on'' turns on keyclick; ``xset -r'' would turn off
     autorepeat; ``xset b 5'' sets the bell volume.

     The parameters for the mouse are ``acceleration'' and
     ``threshold''.  The acceleration of the mouse only takes
     effect if the ``threshold'' is exceeded.

     The parameters for a pixel are the color map entry number in
     decimal, and a color specification.  The root window colors
     can be changed by altering entries 0 and 1.  The map entry
     must not be a read-only color, or an error will result.

     The parameters for the screen saver function determines how
     long the server must be inactive for screen saving to go on,
     and the period to change the background pattern to avoid
     burn in.  The arguments are specified in minutes.	Using the
     v option sets the preference to blank the video (if the
     hardware can do so) rather than display a background pat-
     tern.  Using the s option sets the preference to display a
     pattern rather than blank the video.

     These settings will be reset to default values when you log
     out.

     Note that not all X implementations are guaranteed to honor
     all of these options.
