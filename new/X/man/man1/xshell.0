NAME
     xshell - X Window System, key/button command exec

SYNOPSIS
     xshell [ _o_p_t_i_o_n_s ] [ _h_o_s_t:_d_i_s_p_l_a_y ] ...

DESCRIPTION
     _X_s_h_e_l_l is a program for starting up X applications with a
     single key or button stroke.  It displays a scallop shell
     icon in which button and key presses stand for different
     commands.	The user can bind a command string to any key or
     button by inserting a line like the following in his or her

	 xshell.action.keyname:   command to be exec'ed

     Keynames are simply letters, numbers, and symbols as they
     appear on the keyboard (e.g. a, $, 9), or one of the follow-
     ing special names (taken from the X keyboard definitions):

	 KEYPAD0	      FUNC1	       E1
	 KEYPAD.	      FUNC2	       E2
	 ENTER		      FUNC3	       E3
	 KEYPAD1	      FUNC4	       E4
	 KEYPAD2	      FUNC5	       E5
	 KEYPAD3	      FUNC6	       E6
	 KEYPAD4	      FUNC7	       LEFTARROW
	 KEYPAD5	      FUNC8	       RIGHTARROW
	 KEYPAD6	      FUNC9	       DOWNARROW
	 KEYPAD,	      FUNC10	       UPARROW
	 KEYPAD7	      FUNC11	       SHIFT
	 KEYPAD8	      FUNC12	       CONTROL
	 KEYPAD9	      FUNC13	       LOCK
	 KEYPAD-	      FUNC14	       SYMBOL
	 PF1		      FUNC15
	 PF2		      FUNC16
	 PF3		      FUNC17
	 PF4		      FUNC18
	 LEFTBUTTON	      FUNC19
	 MIDDLEBUTTON	      FUNC29
	 RIGHTBUTTON


     Thus, the following `.Xdefaults' definitions specify that
     the Left Button will spawn a terminal window, the Middle
     Button an editor, the Right Button a calculator, $ a Bourne
     shell, and # a superuser shell:

	 xshell.action.LeftButton:	 xterm =80x65-0+0 -fn 6x10
	 xshell.action.MiddleButton:	 xted =80x65+0-0
	 xshell.action.RightButton:	 xterm =20x20-0-0 -fn 6x10 -e dc
	 xshell.action.$:		 xterm =80x65+0+0 -fn 6x10 -e sh
	 xshell.action.#:		 xterm =80x65+0+0 -fn 6x10 -e su

     _X_s_h_e_l_l breaks the command string up into words by removing
     all white space (i.e.  tabs and spaces) and uses the vfork()
     and execvp() system calls to spawn off the command.  A more
     complicated parsing algorithm could easily be added, but the
     current method is adequate (and fast and memory efficient).

     One thing to keep in mind is that _x_s_h_e_l_l is NOT a window
     manager.  It was written to make popping up frequently used
     utilities as painless as possible (how many times have you
     found that you need just 1 more window....).  It might make
     a nice addition to some of the more verbose window managers,
     but it runs quite nicely as a separate program.


ARGUMENTS
     _X_s_h_e_l_l is designed to be somewhat compatible with _x_c_l_o_c_k in
     the arguments that it takes.  However, _x_s_h_e_l_l will allow you
     to abbreviate its longer flags to any length you chose.
     Thus, the -reverse flag can be spelled out, given as -rev,
     or even just -r:

     -fg _c_o_l_o_r On color displays, determines the color of the
	       foreground.

     -bg _c_o_l_o_r On color displays, determines the color of the
	       background.

     -bd _c_o_l_o_r On color displays, determines the color of the
	       border.

     -bw _p_i_x_e_l_s
	       Specify the width in pixels of the border around
	       the _x_s_h_e_l_l window.

     -v[olume] _n
	       Volume for calls to _X_F_e_e_p, used when errors (such
	       as unbound key) are found.

     -f[lash] _n
	       Number of times to flash the shell window to ack-
	       nowledge a button or key press.

     -d[elay] _n
	       One-hundredths of a second to wait between flashs
	       (default is 5).

     -r[everse]
	       Reverse video (swap foreground and background).

     -q[uiet]  Do not `feep' on errors (see volume).

     -s[mall]  Use a smaller (48x48) version of the shell icon.
	       The default icon is 96x96.

     =_g_e_o_m_e_t_r_y By default _x_s_h_e_l_l will create a window the size of
	       whatever icon you select; the standard X window
	       geometry argument will override this.  See _X(_1)
	       for details.

     _h_o_s_t:_d_i_s_p_l_a_y
	       specifies the display on which to put the _x_s_h_e_l_l
	       window.	This overrides the DISPLAY environment
	       variable.


X DEFAULTS
     To make invoking _x_s_h_e_l_l easier, each of the flags listed
     above may be specified in the user's

     Foreground
	       gives the foreground color.

     Background
	       gives the background color.

     Border    gives the border color.

     BorderWidth
	       gives the border width.

     ReverseVideo
	       if "on", the shell icon should be white on black
	       instead of black on white.

     Volume    gives the volume to use in calls to XFeep().

     Flash     gives the number of times to flash the shell win-
	       dow to acknowledge key or button presses.

     Delay     gives hundredths of a second to wait in between
	       flashes.

     Quiet     prevents _x_s_h_e_l_l from feeping at you when you mis-
	       type.

     IconSize  if "small", a halfsize (48x48) version of the
	       scallopshell is used.

     WindowGeometry
	       gives the shell window size using standard X
	       =WxH+X+Y notation.

ENVIRONMENT
     DISPLAY   To get the default host and display number.

DIAGNOSTICS
     If -quiet is not given on the command line or
     ``xshell.Quiet: on'' does not appear in the user's ._X_d_e_-
     _f_a_u_l_t_s, _x_s_h_e_l_l will `feep' if a key or button is pressed for
     which there is no definition in the ._X_d_e_f_a_u_l_t_s file.

BUGS
     _X_s_h_e_l_l uses the XGetDefault call to fetch the command string
     for a given key.  Thus, you cannot bind the colon (``:'')
     character to a command.

     A more `user-friendly' interface could include dialog boxes
     that the user could pop up to type in a command directly so
     that a full shell doesn't have to be started.  Then again,
     it is nice and compact now and if you really need to do that
     more than once you should use a real shell.

     This program along with _x_w_m(_1) and _x_n_w_m have been mostly
     superceded by _u_w_m(_1).
