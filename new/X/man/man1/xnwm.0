DESCRIPTION
     The window manager is a process that allows the user of a
     display running the X window system to manipulate the win-
     dows on the screen.  X implements the `desktop model' of
     overlapping windows; _x_n_w_m allows windows to be moved, iconi-
     fied, and resized, allows the order of the windows in the
     `stack' of overlapping windows to be manipulated, and allows
     the keyboard focus to be attached to a window.  X allows
     windows to contain other windows, but _x_n_w_m only manipulates
     the top-level windows and not any of the subwindows.

     _X_n_w_m takes arguments _h_o_s_t and _d_i_s_p_l_a_y, which refer the the
     host and display number.  For example `xnwm amadeus:1' would
     start up the window manager on display one on the machine
     amadeus.  By default, _x_n_w_m uses the host and display number
     stored in the environment variable DISPLAY, and therefore
     they are not normally specified.

     _X_n_w_m has 2 modes of operation, `normal' and `popup',  In
     normal mode _x_n_w_m creates a menu window across the top of the
     screen.  To perform an action, you click any mouse button in
     the appropriate menu box and then click the same button in
     the window you wish to affect.  _X_n_w_m also reserves certain
     button/key combinations and interprets them as operations on
     existing windows.	The key combination is specified in the
     command line with some subset of the options: -c (Control),
     -m (Meta), and -s (Shift).  For example, if you specify the
     options -cm then the Control and Meta keys must be down at
     the time a mouse button is depressed.  The option -n (None)
     means that no buttons need be held down.  This is
     discouraged since it means that applications will never
     receive unshifted mouse clicks.  If no combination is speci-
     fied in the command line, Meta is assumed.  Note:	the key
     combination is not necessary when using functions from the
     menu; it is only needed with the assigned button functions
     to distinguish window manager operations from operations
     destined for the application running within the window.

     The window manager normally takes control of the screen at
     various times to assure that the screen image remains
     correct while performing window manager operations.  When
     this happens, requests from other applications are tem-
     porarily suspended until the window manager finishes the

     operation.  The option -f (no freeze) disables this.  If
     this option is specified, window outlines for _M_o_v_e and
     _R_e_s_i_z_e will flicker rather than remaining solid, and the
     background behind popup windows (see later) will take longer
     to redraw.

     The options -t (thin), -v (vertical), and -2 (2 rows) con-
     trol the format of the menu bar.  In the absence of any of
     these, the menu extends across the entire screen.	If the -t
     option is given, the menu bar will not extend fully across
     the screen; instead there will be room at the right (con-
     venient for, for example, a clock window).  If the -v option
     is used, the menu windows are stacked vertically instead of
     spread horizontally.  The -2 option causes the menu windows
     to be in two rows, allowing room for a terminal window the
     height of the screen while still allowing menu access.
     Either of the last two options automatically selects the -t
     option.  The menu is located in the upper left corner of the
     screen by default, but its location can be set with the
     =_g_e_o_m_e_t_r_y option as usual with X applications.  (Notice that
     there is no size component, position information is used
     only.)

     _X_n_w_m will use reverse video for the menu, the cursor, icon
     text, and the frame around selected windows if the -r
     (reverse) option is used.

     The border width around selected windows can be changed with
     the @ argument; the default is 5 pixels.

     The default font for displaying text is ``8x13''.	You can
     specify a different font with the fm= (Menu font), fi= (Icon
     font), and the fs= (Size window font) options.

     Initially, the left, middle, and right mouse buttons are
     bound to the operations _S_e_l_e_c_t, _R_a_i_s_e, and _M_o_v_e. You can
     change these bindings with the l= (left), m= (middle), and
     r= (right) arguments.  Each should be followed by one of the
     letters "srmilzc", representing, respectively, _S_e_l_e_c_t,
     _R_a_i_s_e, _M_o_v_e, _I_c_o_n_i_f_y, _L_o_w_e_r, _r_e_s_i_Z_e, and _C_i_r_c_u_l_a_t_e. They may
     also be followed by nothing, in which case no function is
     bound to that key.

     Clicking any button that is not bound to the _S_e_l_e_c_t function
     in the background will cause the menu window to become visi-
     ble if it has become covered by other windows.  Double
     clicking the background will cause the menu to move back to
     its original position.

     In popup mode, the menu window is not normally displayed,
     but instead `pops up' when a particular button is pressed.
     To get popup mode, bind the letter ``p'' to any of the three

     buttons as described above.  (You may also bind the other
     buttons as desired.)  Whenever the bound button is clicked
     while the appropriate combination of control, meta, and
     shift keys is depressed, or any time a button that is not
     bound to the _S_e_l_e_c_t function is clicked in the background,
     the menu will appear beneath the cursor.  You may then
     select any menu function you wish; after the operation is
     completed the menu will disappear.  To make the menu disap-
     pear without performing any operation, just move the cursor
     out of the menu area.  Note:  the mouse button bound to the
     popup function may not be rebound using Assign. Using popup
     mode with complicated screen images and with no freeze (the
     -f option) may cause some difficulties if the menu obscures
     the image, since the applications will have to redraw their
     windows after the menu goes away.

     The available commands are described below.  For any of
     these commands, if you press a button to start a command,
     and then want to abort the command, simply press one of the
     other buttons before releasing the first button.

     Select attaches the keyboard to a window, i.e., keyboard
     input will go to that window (hierarchy) even when the mouse
     is outside the window.  It also Raises the selected window.
     Selecting the background will detach the keyboard from any
     window (actually, it attaches it to the background window).
     If no window is selected the keyboard input will go to the
     window which currently contains the mouse cursor.	The
     selected window is highlighted by drawing a partial frame
     around the window.  Selecting an icon allows the icon name
     to be edited: the delete key deletes the last character,
     control-U deletes the entire name, and other characters are
     appended to the current name.  Typing a return restores the
     input focus to the most recent non-icon window selected.

     Raise raises the window to the top of any stack of overlap-
     ping windows.

     Move is used to move a window.  If you apply it to a window,
     an outline will be moved with the mouse; when you release
     the button, the window will be moved.

     (De)Iconify will make a window into an icon.  If the mouse
     is moved more than a threshold amount, or this is the first
     time the window has been iconified, the icon will appear at
     the location on the screen where the button is released.
     Otherwise, the icon will reappear at its previous location.
     This threshold may be changed with the %_i_c_o_n_D_e_l_t_a option.
     Giving a negative value will disable this effect.	The
     default is 5 pixels.  (De)Iconify will make the original
     window reappear at its former position on the screen if it
     is applied to an icon.  The name displayed in the icon can

     be edited by Selecting the icon.

     Lower will `push' the window you point at to the bottom of
     any stack of overlapping windows.

     Resize is used to resize a window by moving a corner or an
     edge.  If you apply it to a window, a rubber banded outline
     of the window will be displayed and moving the mouse will
     change its size, leaving the opposite corner or other edges
     fixed.  The corner or edge to be moved depends on the where
     the mouse is when the button is pressed.  Imagine the window
     divided with grid of nine rectangles.  If the mouse is in
     one of the four corner rectangles or the center rectangle,
     then the corner closest to the mouse will be moved; other-
     wise, the closest edge will be moved.  When the button is
     released, the window will be resized.

     Circulate causes the lowest window in the stack of overlap-
     ping windows to be Raised ; successive applications will
     reveal every window in turn.

     Assign allows you to change the button bindings; to use it
     click any button in the Assign menu window and then click
     the same button in any other function to assign that func-
     tion to that button.  To remove the assignment from a but-
     ton, double click the Assign window.
