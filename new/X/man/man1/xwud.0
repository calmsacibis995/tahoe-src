NAME
     xwud - X Window System, window image undumper

SYNOPSIS
     xwud [ -debug ] [ -help ] [ -inverse ] [ -in _f_i_l_e ] [
     _h_o_s_t:_d_i_s_p_l_a_y ]

DESCRIPTION
     _X_w_u_d is an X Window System (protocol version 10) window
     image undumping utility.  _X_w_u_d allows X users to display
     window images that were saved in a specially formatted win-
     dow dump file.  The window  image	will  appear  at  the
     coordinates of the original window from which the dump was
     taken.  This is a crude version of a more advanced utility
     that will be released in the future.  The window dump file
     format is currently under development; no guarantee of
     upward compatibility is made: the format will be completely
     different under V11. Monochrome dump files are displayed on
     a color monitor in the default foreground and background
     colors.

     NOTE: Windows can only be undumped on a display have at
     least as many bit planes as the original display.

ARGUMENT SUMMARY
     -help   Print out the `Usage:' command syntax summary.

     -in _f_i_l_e
	     This argument allows the user to explicitly specify
	     the input file on the command line.  The default is
	     to take input from standard in.

     -inverse
	     Applies to monochrome window dump files only. If
	     selected, the window is undumped in reverse video.
	     This is mainly needed because the display is `write
	     white', whereas dump files intended eventually to be
	     written to a printer are generally `write black'.

     _h_o_s_t:_d_i_s_p_l_a_y
	     This  argument  allow  you  to  specify the host and
	     display number on which to display the window dump.
	     For example `xwud orpheus:1' would specify that the
	     dump will appear on display `1' on the machine
	     `orpheus'.  By default, _x_w_u_d uses the host and
	     display number stored in the environment variable
	     DISPLAY, and therefore this argument is not normally
	     specified.

ENVIRONMENT
     DISPLAY To get default host and display number.

BUGS
     Cannot always undump a XY format color dump file with the
     correct colors since the original pixel-to-color correspon-
     dence will be lost if new color-map pixels have to be allo-
     cated.
