NAME
     xload - X window system load average display

SYNOPSIS
     xload [ option ] ...

DESCRIPTION
     _x_l_o_a_d continuously displays the system load average under
     the _X window system.  _x_l_o_a_d creates a window in which the
     load average is represented as a bar graph with n divisions.
     Each division represents one unit of load average.  The name
     of the host is displayed in the upper left corner.

     _x_l_o_a_d understands the following options:

     -bd _c_o_l_o_r
	     Specify the border color.	On monochrome displays
	     this option is ignored.  The default color is
	     ``black''.

     -bg _c_o_l_o_r
	     Specify the background color.  On monochrome
	     displays this option is ignored.  The default color
	     is ``white''.

     -bw _p_i_x_e_l_s
	     Specify the width in pixels of the border around the
	     _x_l_o_a_d window. The default value is 3 pixels.

     -fg _c_o_l_o_r
	     Specify the graph color.  On monochrome displays
	     this option is ignored.  The default color is
	     ``black''.

     -fn _f_o_n_t_n_a_m_e
	     The hostname will be displayed in the specified font
	     (if none is specified, this defaults to 6x10).

     -hl _c_o_l_o_r
	     Specify the hostname and scale line color; the
	     default is to make it the same as the graph color.

     -rv     Reverses the default color values (i.e., black
	     becomes white and white becomes black).

     -fw     Forces the default color values to remain at their
	     predetermined settings (i.e., white is white and
	     black is black).

     -scale _i_n_t_e_g_e_r
	     Specify the minimum number of divisions on the graph
	     (default 1).  _X_l_o_a_d is free to use more divisions if

	     the load gets too high to display, but it will never
	     use fewer divisions than this.

     -update _s_e_c_o_n_d_s
	     Specify the frequency in seconds with which _x_l_o_a_d
	     updates its display (except if the _x_l_o_a_d window is
	     obscured and then exposed, immediate redisplay
	     occurs).  The default update frequency is 5 seconds.
	     Specification of a frequency less than 5 seconds is
	     ignored and the default frequency is used instead.

     =_g_e_o_m_e_t_r_y
	     The load graph window is created with the specified
	     size and location determined by the supplied
	     geometry specification.  See _X(_1) for a full expla-
	     nation.

     [_h_o_s_t]:[_d_i_s_p_l_a_y]
	     Normally, _x_l_o_a_d gets the host and display number to
	     use from the environment variable ``DISPLAY''.
	     Either or both can be specified with this option.
	     _h_o_s_t specifies which machine to create the _x_l_o_a_d
	     window on, and _d_i_s_p_l_a_y specifies the display number.
	     For example, ``mit-grape-nehi:0'' creates an _x_l_o_a_d
	     on display 0 on machine mit-grape-nehi. Either value
	     can be defaulted by omission but ``:'' is necessary
	     to specify one or both.

X DEFAULTS
     Foreground
	     Set the graph color.  Ignored on monochrome
	     displays.

     Background
	     Set the background color.	Ignored on monochrome
	     display.

     BodyFont
	     Set the hostname font.

     ReverseVideo
	     If ``on'', reverse the effect of the defaults
	     colors.  Ignored on color displays.

     Scale   Set the minimum scale.

     Update  Set the update interval.

ENVIRONMENT
     DISPLAY - to get the default host and display number.

SEE ALSO
     X(10, xwm(1), X(8C), mem(4), select(2)

DIAGNOSTICS
     Unable to open display or create window. Unable to open
     /dev/kmem.  Unable to query window for dimensions. Various X
     errors.

BUGS
     _x_l_o_a_d requires the ability to open and read /dev/kmem. On
     most systems, this requires the suid bit set with root own-
     ership or the sgid bit set and membership in the same group
     as /dev/kmem.
