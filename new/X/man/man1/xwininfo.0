NAME
     xwininfo - X Window System, window information summarizer.

SYNOPSIS
     xwininfo [ -children ] [ -help ] [ -id _i_d ] [ -int ] [ -root
     ] [ _h_o_s_t:_d_i_s_p_l_a_y ]

DESCRIPTION
     _X_w_i_n_i_n_f_o is  a  utility  for  displaying  X  window informa-
     tion summaries.  All pertinent window  information  is
     displayed	in  an	easily	readable format.   The	user has
     the option of selecting the target window with the mouse (by
     clicking any mouse button in the desired window)  or  by
     specifying its' window id on the command line with the -id
     argument.	There is also a special -root argument to quickly
     obtain information on X's root window.  The following is a
     sample summary taken with the -children argument specified.

     xwininfo ==> Please select the window you wish
	      ==> information on by clicking the
	      ==> mouse in that window.

     xwininfo ==> Window name: ' X Root Window '

ARGUMENT SUMMARY
     -children
	     This  argument  specifies that _x_w_i_n_i_n_f_o should list
	     the window ids' of target	window's  children.
	     Only  the	first  level  of  the  window hierarchy
	     is shown (i.e., immediate children of the target
	     window).

     -help   Print out the 'Usage:' command syntax summary.

     -id _i_d  This argument allows the user to specify a target
	     window  _i_d  on  the command  line rather than using
	     the mouse to select the target window.  This is very
	     useful in	debugging  X  applications  where  the
	     target window is not mapped to the screen or where
	     the use of the mouse might be impossible or inter-
	     fere with the application.

     -int    This argument specifies that all X window ids should
	     be  displayed  as integer values.	The default is to
	     display them as hexadecimal values.

     -root   This  argument  specifies	that  X's root window is
	     the target window.  This is useful in situations
	     where  the  root  window  is  completely obscured.

     _h_o_s_t:_d_i_s_p_l_a_y
	     This  argument  allow  you  to  specify the host and
	     display number on which to find the target window.
	     For example `xwininfo orpheus:1' would specify that
	     the target window is on display `1' on the machine
	     `orpheus'.  By default, _x_w_i_n_i_n_f_o uses  the  host
	     and display number stored in the environment vari-
	     able DISPLAY, and therefore this argument is not
	     normally specified.

ENVIRONMENT
     DISPLAY To get default host and display number.

FUTURE PLANS
     If time ever presents itself...

     1.      Provide a `-geometry' argument that prints out the
	     window's dimensions in X window geometry format

	     (i.e., =WxH+X+Y)

     2.      Provide a `-depth' argument that allows  recursive
	     traversal	of  the window hierarchy to some arbi-
	     trary depth.
