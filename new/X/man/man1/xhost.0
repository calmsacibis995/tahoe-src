NAME
     xhost - X window system access control program

SYNOPSIS
     xhost [+-]host ...

DESCRIPTION
     _X_h_o_s_t is used to add and delete hosts to the list of
     machines X will accept connections from.  This is an elemen-
     tary form of privacy control, since otherwise X would be
     willing to create windows for anyone on the internet.  It is
     only sufficient for a workstation (single user) environment,
     though it does limit the worst abuses.

     If you want to set up hosts that you always trust, you can
     specify them in your login file, or you can specify the
     hosts in the file /_e_t_c/_X*._h_o_s_t_s, where * is the number of
     the display on the machine.

     Specifying a host name (with an optional leading plus sign)
     adds that host to the list; use a leading minus sign to
     delete a host.

     DECnet nodes should be specified as names with trailing
     ``::''.

     This program can only be executed on the machine the display
     is connected to.

     It is possible to remove the current host from the access
     list. Be warned that you can't undo this without logging
     out.

     _X_h_o_s_t with no arguments will print the current hosts allowed
     to access your display.

FILES
     /etc/X*.hosts

SEE ALSO
     X(8C), xterm(1)

ENVIRONMENT
     DISPLAY   -    To find out which X you are using.
