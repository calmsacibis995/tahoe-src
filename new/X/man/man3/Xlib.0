NAME
     Xlib - C Language X Window System Interface Library

SYNOPSIS
     #include <X/Xlib.h>

DESCRIPTION
     This library is the low level interface for C to the X pro-
     tocol.  The list of subroutines is too long to list here,
     comprising more than 150 subroutines.

     This library gives complete access to all capability pro-
     vided by the X window system, and is intended to be the
     basis for other higher level libraries for use with X (See
     _X_t_e_x_t(_3_x) for an example of such a library).

     More subroutines will be added to this library with time.
     Contributions will be gratefully accepted.
