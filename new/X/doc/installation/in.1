Overview
.PP
Given an X distribution hierarchy, the following basic steps need
to be performed:
.DS
1) read in the tape.
2) decide where you want to install fonts (and firmware if you are using
  VS100 displays).  We recommend leaving this alone unless you have
  some good reason.
3) configure the site file(s) for the displays you use for this information.
4) build all software.
5) install the software into the directories.
.sp
The following steps may not be needed (or possible) on some systems.

6) add a device driver or configure the device driver into your kernel.
7) rename pseudo-teletypes for your login window.
8) test that everything is working.
9) configure your /etc/ttys file for the display.

By default, X is distributed to install on a stock 4.3BSD system;
installation under Ultrix-32 release 1.2 should essentially be the same.
