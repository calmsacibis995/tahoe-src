This directory contains the X Windows (Version 10) driver for the Integrated
Solutions Optimum V WorkStations, both monochrome and color.  It requires
Integrated Solutions Software Release 3.07.

The IS driver expects the following entries in ../X/X.h in the section on
"device identifiers returned by X_SetUp":

/* Integrated Solutions address space 900-999 */
#define XDEV_ISI		900		/* ISI base address	*/
#define XDEV_ISIBW		XDEV_ISI+1	/* Optimum V monochrome	*/
#define XDEV_ISICOLOR4		XDEV_ISI+2	/* Optimum V 4-bit color*/


The IS driver makes use of the Integrated Solutions graphics interface
processor library (libgip), and should be linked with the following command
in ../X/Makefile when building the IS server (Xis):

XISLIB=	../libis/libis.a
ISLIB=	$(XISLIB) -lgip

is: $(OBJS) $(XISLIB)
	${CC} ${CFLAGS} -o Xis $(OBJS) $(STDLIB) $(ISLIB)

Other variables should already be defined in the Makefile.


The IS driver requires both read and write permission on /dev/vmem (video
memory) to mmap it into the server's address space.  /dev/vmem can be made
readable and writable, or the server can be installed setuid root using the
following install command in ../X/Makefile:

	install -s -m 4755 Xis ${DESTDIR}${CONFDIR}

This usually doesn't matter, since Xis is typically started by xinit, which
is setuid root.  In any case, the real and effective uid's are reset to
the current uid immediately after the mmap succeeds.


The server man page can be found in Xis.8c.


is-copyright.h contains applicable copyright notices.


On Integrated Solutions releases, the font and uwm directories are in
/usr/lib/X.  X applications are in /usr/isi.  X libraries are in /usr/lib.
The location of most of these can be controlled by each site.
