	Changes from release 2 to release 3 of X

X should now build as distributed without it being necessary to install
/usr/include/X first.  The C client code should now compile and run on a
Sun running Sun 2.0 or later.  The server implementation is preliminary.
The client code has also been ported to the IBM RT/PC, and should run.
Work on the server is well underway, but not yet complete.  Estimated
competion is the beginning of April, 1986 for the IBM RT/PC displays.
