It should be noted here that the paper on bitblt is not up to date
and does not reflect all the changes or modifications to the bltter. 
It was our intention to provide a more current release of the paper 
but time has run out. We hope that this paper will give you a reasonable
understanding of bitblt.

In this directory is a paper which describes the emulator function added
to 4.2A. This feature was used by this implementation of X to gather 
keyboard and mouse events and place them in shared memory event queue.
The emulator paper (emulator.paper) and X emulator man page (xemul.4)
should be read to gain an uderstanding of how the shared memory interface
was implemented for X on the IBM RT/PC.

There are several other man pages provided that give descriptions of
each of the individual displays, the keyboard and mouse.
